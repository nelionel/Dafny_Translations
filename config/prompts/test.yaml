  You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.

  I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

  **The Method to Test:**
  The Dafny method you need to test is named `{entry_point}`.

  **Python Test Code:**
  ```python
  {test_code}
  ```

  **Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
  ```dafny
  {dafny_solution_code}
  ```

  **Your Task:**
  1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
     - Note the exact name (`{entry_point}`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

  2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
     - Create a dummy version of the `{entry_point}` Dafny method.
     - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
     - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

  3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
     - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{{:test}}` attribute.
     - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
     - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
     - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
     - Each test method should:
       a. Call the `{entry_point}` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
       b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

  **Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
  <dummy>
  function add(a: int, b: int): int
  {{
      0
  }}
  </dummy>

  ```dafny
  method {{:test}} test_0()
  {{
      var result := add(2, 3);
      expect result == 5;
  }}
  ```

correction: |
  Your previous attempt failed to generate valid, compilable Dafny code.

  Here is the compilation error that occurred when your generated tests were combined with your generated dummy method:
  <compilation_error>
  {compilation_error}
  </compilation_error>

  Please analyze the error and provide a complete, fixed response.
  You MUST provide BOTH the corrected dummy implementation in a `<dummy>` block AND the corrected, complete test code in a ```dafny ... ``` block.
