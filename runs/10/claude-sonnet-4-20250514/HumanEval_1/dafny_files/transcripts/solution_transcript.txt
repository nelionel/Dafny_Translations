You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python
from typing import List


def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
    separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    Ignore any spaces in the input string.
    >>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
    ['()', '(())', '(()())']
    """

from typing import List


def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
    separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    Ignore any spaces in the input string.
    >>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
    ['()', '(())', '(()())']
    """
    # Remove all spaces from the input string
    paren_string = paren_string.replace(' ', '')
    
    result = []
    current_group = ""
    balance = 0
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
            current_group += char
        elif char == ')':
            balance -= 1
            current_group += char
            
            # When balance reaches 0, we have a complete group
            if balance == 0:
                result.append(current_group)
                current_group = ""
    
    return result
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `separate_paren_groups`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Function signature and types:**
   - Input: `paren_string: str` (a string)
   - Output: `List[str]` (a list of strings)
   - In Dafny: input `string`, output `seq<string>`

2. **Function logic:**
   - Remove all spaces from input string
   - Iterate through each character
   - Keep track of balance (number of open parens minus closed parens)
   - Build current group string
   - When balance reaches 0, we have a complete group, add it to result
   - Return result

3. **Pre-conditions:**
   - The input should be a valid string containing only parentheses and spaces
   - Each group should be balanced
   - Groups should not be nested within each other

4. **Post-conditions:**
   - Result contains all separate balanced parentheses groups
   - No spaces in the result strings
   - Each string in result is a balanced parentheses group

5. **Loop analysis:**
   - Single for loop iterating through characters of the string
   - Loop invariant: balance >= 0 (we never have more closing than opening parens)
   - Loop invariant: current_group contains partial group being built
   - Loop invariant: result contains all complete groups found so far

6. **Termination:**
   - The loop terminates because we iterate through a finite string
   - Decreases clause: length of remaining string to process

Let me implement this in Dafny:

```dafny
method separate_paren_groups(paren_string: string) returns (result: seq<string>)
    requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |paren_string| ==> paren_string[i] == '(' || paren_string[i] == ')' || paren_string[i] == ' '
    ensures |result| >= 0
{
    // Remove spaces from input string
    var cleaned := "";
    var i := 0;
    while i < |paren_string|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |paren_string|
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < |cleaned| ==> cleaned[j] == '(' || cleaned[j] == ')'
        decreases |paren_string| - i
    {
        if paren_string[i] != ' ' {
            cleaned := cleaned + [paren_string[i]];
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    
    result := [];
    var current_group := "";
    var balance := 0;
    var

I'll continue the implementation by processing the cleaned string to separate balanced parentheses groups. The key steps involve tracking the balance of parentheses and building groups as we iterate through the characters. I'll carefully manage the group construction and tracking to ensure we capture each balanced group correctly.

When a closing parenthesis brings the balance to zero, we've completed a valid group. At that point, I'll add the current group to the result and reset the current group for the next potential group. This approach ensures we handle nested and sequential parentheses groups systematically.

The implementation will maintain invariants about balance and group composition, ensuring we only collect valid, balanced parentheses sequences. By tracking the running balance and constructing groups incrementally, we can reliably separate the input string into its constituent balanced parentheses groups.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Function signature and types:**
   - Input: `paren_string: str` (a string)  
   - Output: `List[str]` (a list of strings)
   - In Dafny: input `string`, output `seq<string>`

2. **Function logic:**
   - Remove all spaces from input string
   - Iterate through each character
   - Keep track of balance (open parens count minus closed parens count)
   - Build current group string character by character
   - When balance reaches 0, we have a complete balanced group
   - Add complete group to result and reset current group
   - Return list of all groups

3. **Pre-conditions:**
   - The function should handle any string input (robust design)
   - The documentation implies input contains balanced parentheses groups

4. **Post-conditions:**
   - Result is a sequence of strings
   - Each string in result represents a balanced parentheses group
   - No spaces in result strings

5. **Loop analysis:**
   - Two loops: one for removing spaces, one for processing parentheses
   - Main loop invariants: balance >= 0, current_group builds correctly
   - Termination: both loops iterate through finite strings

6. **Termination:**
   - Both loops have clear decreasing measures based on remaining string length
