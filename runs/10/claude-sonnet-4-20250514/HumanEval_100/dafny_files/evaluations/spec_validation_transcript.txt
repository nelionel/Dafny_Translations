=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

    Examples:
    >>> make_a_pile(3)
    [3, 5, 7]
    """
    pile = []
    current_stones = n
    
    for i in range(n):
        pile.append(current_stones)
        current_stones += 2  # Jump to next odd/even number
    
    return pile
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
method make_a_pile(n: int) returns (pile: seq<int>)
    requires n > 0
    ensures |pile| == n
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |pile| ==> pile[i] == n + 2 * i
{
    pile := [];
    var current_stones := n;
    var i := 0;
    
    while i < n
        invariant 0 <= i <= n
        invariant |pile| == i
        invariant current_stones == n + 2 * i
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> pile[j] == n + 2 * j
        decreases n - i
    {
        pile := pile + [current_stones];
        current_stones := current_stones + 2;
        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function and the Dafny specification to see if they match.

Python function behavior:
1. Takes a positive integer n
2. Creates a pile of n levels
3. First level has n stones
4. Each subsequent level has the next odd number if n is odd, or next even number if n is even
5. Returns a list where element at index i represents stones in level (i+1)

Let me trace through the examples:
- make_a_pile(3): n=3 (odd)
  - Level 1: 3 stones
  - Level 2: next odd = 5 stones  
  - Level 3: next odd = 7 stones
  - Result: [3, 5, 7]

So if n is odd, we get: [n, n+2, n+4, n+6, ...]
If n is even, we get: [n, n+2, n+4, n+6, ...]

Wait, actually looking at the code more carefully:

```python
pile = []
current_stones = n

for i in range(n):
    pile.append(current_stones)
    current_stones += 2  # Jump to next odd/even number

return pile
```

So regardless of whether n is odd or even, it starts with n and then adds 2 each time. This means:
- pile[0] = n
- pile[1] = n + 2
- pile[2] = n + 4
- ...
- pile[i] = n + 2*i

The Dafny specification says:
- requires n > 0
- ensures |pile| == n  
- ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |pile| ==> pile[i] == n + 2 * i

This looks correct! Let me double-check:

For make_a_pile(3):
- pile[0] = 3 + 2*0 = 3 ✓


- pile[1] = 3 + 2*1 = 5 ✓  
- pile[2] = 3 + 2*2 = 7 ✓

I verify the function's core logic matches the Dafny specification precisely. The implementation generates a pile where each level increases by 2, starting from the initial number of stones. The specification captures the exact pattern of stone distribution across levels, ensuring the pile's length and element calculation are consistent.

--- RESPONSE ---
THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS

```dafny
method make_a_pile(n: int) returns (pile: seq<int>)
    requires n > 0
    ensures |pile| == n
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |pile| ==> pile[i] == n + 2 * i
{
    pile := [];
    var current_stones := n;
    var i := 0;
    
    while i < n
        invariant 0 <= i <= n
        invariant |pile| == i
        invariant current_stones == n + 2 * i
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> pile[j] == n + 2 * j
        decreases n - i
    {
        pile := pile + [current_stones];
        current_stones := current_stones + 2;
        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```
