=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

    Examples:
    >>> make_a_pile(3)
    [3, 5, 7]
    """

```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `make_a_pile`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python code first:

1. The function `make_a_pile(n)` takes a positive integer `n`.
2. It creates a pile of `n` levels of stones.
3. The first level has `n` stones.
4. For subsequent levels:
   - If n is odd, the next level has the next odd number of stones
   - If n is even, the next level has the next even number of stones
5. It returns a list of integers representing the number of stones in each level.

Looking at the implementation:
- It starts with `current_stones = n`
- For each level (0 to n-1), it appends `current_stones` to the pile and then increments `current_stones` by 2.
- This works because adding 2 to an odd number gives the next odd number, and adding 2 to an even number gives the next even number.

For the Dafny translation:
- Input type: `int` (for n)
- Return type: `seq<int>` (sequence of integers)
- Precondition: `n > 0` (positive integer)
- Postcondition: 
  - The returned sequence has length `n`
  - The first element is `n`
  - Each subsequent element is 2 more than the previous element
  - The sequence represents stones in levels 1 through n

For the loop:
- The loop runs from 0 to n-1
- Loop invariant: the pile so far has the correct elements
- Termination: the loop counter decreases from n to 0

Let me write the Dafny implementation:

```dafny
method make_a_pile(n: int) returns (pile: seq<int>)
    requires n > 0
    ensures |pile| == n
    ensures n > 0 ==> pile[0] == n
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |pile| - 1 ==> pile[i+1] == pile[i] + 2


```

I'll initialize an empty sequence and set up the stone-building process. The method starts by creating an empty pile and setting the initial stone count to `n`. I'll track the current iteration and build the pile systematically, ensuring each level follows the specified pattern of increasing by 2 stones.

The implementation carefully manages the pile construction, maintaining the invariants that track the pile's growth and ensure the correct number of stones at each level. Each iteration adds the current stone count to the pile, progressively building the sequence according to the specified rules.

The key observation is the consistent increment of stones, where each new level adds 2 more stones than the previous one, starting from the initial `n` stones. This creates a predictable and verifiable sequence that meets the method's requirements.

The method systematically builds a pile by tracking the current stone count and index, ensuring each iteration maintains the invariant of generating a sequence where each element follows the pattern `n + 2 * index`. By carefully managing the loop conditions and incrementing both the pile and stone count, we create a mathematically precise pile construction algorithm.

The verification focuses on proving that the final pile meets the specified conditions: correct length and each element's value matching the expected mathematical progression.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python code:

1. **Types**: The function takes a positive integer `n` and returns a list of integers. In Dafny, this would be `int` â†’ `seq<int>`.

2. **Logic**: 
   - Creates a pile with `n` levels
   - First level has `n` stones
   - Each subsequent level has 2 more stones than the previous (next odd if n is odd, next even if n is even)
   - Returns a list where index i represents level (i+1)

3. **Pre/Post conditions**:
   - Requires: `n > 0` (positive integer)
   - Ensures: The returned sequence has length `n`
   - Ensures: Each element at index i has value `n + 2*i`

4. **Loop analysis**:
   - Loop runs from 0 to n-1
   - Invariant: pile length equals current iteration count
   - Invariant: current_stones equals n + 2*iteration_count
   - Invariant: all elements in pile so far follow the pattern
   - Termination: n - i decreases

The algorithm works by starting with n stones and adding 2 each time, which gives the sequence [n, n+2, n+4, ..., n+2*(n-1)].
