=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `make_a_pile`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python
def check(candidate):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert candidate(3) == [3, 5, 7], "Test 3"
    assert candidate(4) == [4,6,8,10], "Test 4"
    assert candidate(5) == [5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
    assert candidate(6) == [6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]
    assert candidate(8) == [8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22]

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method make_a_pile(n: int) returns (pile: seq<int>)
    requires n > 0
    ensures |pile| == n
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |pile| ==> pile[i] == n + 2 * i
{
    pile := [];
    var current_stones := n;
    var i := 0;
    
    while i < n
        invariant 0 <= i <= n
        invariant |pile| == i
        invariant current_stones == n + 2 * i
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> pile[j] == n + 2 * j
        decreases n - i
    {
        pile := pile + [current_stones];
        current_stones := current_stones + 2;
        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`make_a_pile`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `make_a_pile` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `make_a_pile` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the given Python test code and the Dafny solution.

From the Python test code:
- `candidate(3) == [3, 5, 7]`
- `candidate(4) == [4,6,8,10]`
- `candidate(5) == [5, 7, 9, 11, 13]`
- `candidate(6) == [6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]`
- `candidate(8) == [8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22]`
- `assert True` - this is always true, so I should include it but it's trivial

From the Dafny solution:
- Method name: `make_a_pile`
- Signature: `method make_a_pile(n: int) returns (pile: seq<int>)`
- Requires: `n > 0`
- Ensures: `|pile| == n` and `forall i :: 0 <= i < |pile| ==> pile[i] == n + 2 * i`

So the pattern is: given n, it returns a sequence of n elements where the i-th element is n + 2*i.

For the dummy implementation, I need to create a method with the same signature that returns a default value. For sequences, the default would be an empty sequence `[]`.

For the tests, I need to translate each assert:
1. `assert candidate(3) == [3, 5, 7]` becomes a test calling `make_a_pile(3)` and expecting `[3, 5, 7]`
2. `assert candidate(4) == [4,6,8,10]` becomes a test calling `make_a_pile(4)` and expecting `[4, 6, 8, 10]`
3. `assert candidate(5) == [5, 7, 9, 11, 13]` becomes a test calling `make_a_pile(5)` and expecting `[5, 7, 9, 11, 13]`


4. `assert candidate(6) == [6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]` becomes a test calling `make_a_pile(6)` and expecting `[6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]`
5. `assert candidate(8) == [8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22]` becomes a test calling `make_a_pile(8)` and expecting `[8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22]`

I'll continue translating the remaining test cases, focusing on the pattern of generating sequences based on the input number. The tests consistently demonstrate how the method creates a sequence where each element follows a specific arithmetic progression starting from the input number.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the Python tests and the Dafny solution:

**Analysis:**
- The method name is `make_a_pile`
- It takes an integer `n` and returns a sequence of integers
- The signature is `method make_a_pile(n: int) returns (pile: seq<int>)`
- The tests check various inputs (3, 4, 5, 6, 8) and their expected outputs

<dummy>
method make_a_pile(n: int) returns (pile: seq<int>)
{
    pile := [];
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := make_a_pile(3);
    expect result == [3, 5, 7];
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := make_a_pile(4);
    expect result == [4, 6, 8, 10];
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := make_a_pile(5);
    expect result == [5, 7, 9, 11, 13];
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := make_a_pile(6);
    expect result == [6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16];
}

method {:test} test_4()
{
    var result := make_a_pile(8);
    expect result == [8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22];
}

method {:test} test_5()
{
    expect true;
}
```
