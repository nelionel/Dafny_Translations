=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def choose_num(x, y):
    """This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the
    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If 
    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.

    For example:
    choose_num(12, 15) = 14
    choose_num(13, 12) = -1
    """

def choose_num(x, y):
    """This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the
    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If 
    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.

    For example:
    choose_num(12, 15) = 14
    choose_num(13, 12) = -1
    """
    # If x > y, the range is invalid
    if x > y:
        return -1
    
    # Start from y and find the largest even number
    if y % 2 == 0:
        # y is even, so it's our answer
        return y
    else:
        # y is odd, check if y-1 is in range
        if y - 1 >= x:
            return y - 1
        else:
            # No even number in range
            return -1
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `choose_num`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. The function `choose_num` takes two positive integers `x` and `y`
2. It returns the biggest even integer in the range [x, y] inclusive
3. If no such even integer exists, it returns -1

The algorithm:
- If x > y, return -1 (invalid range)
- If y is even, return y (it's the largest even number in the range)
- If y is odd, check if y-1 is >= x. If so, return y-1. Otherwise return -1.

For Dafny:
- Parameters: x: int, y: int
- Return type: int
- Preconditions: Since the documentation says "positive numbers", we should require x > 0 and y > 0
- Postconditions: 
  - If result != -1, then result is even and x <= result <= y
  - If result == -1, then there's no even number in [x, y]
  - The result is the maximum even number in [x, y] if it exists

Let me think about the postconditions more carefully:
- If x > y, result == -1
- If x <= y:
  - If there exists an even number in [x, y], then result is the maximum such even number
  - If there's no even number in [x, y], then result == -1

Actually, let me be more precise:
- result == -1 iff there's no even number in [x, y]
- If result != -1, then result is even, x <= result <= y, and for all even numbers e in [x, y], e <= result

The algorithm is straightforward and doesn't involve loops or recursion, so no decreases clause needed.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Types**: The function takes two integers `x` and `y` and returns an integer. In Dafny, these will be `int` types.

2. **Logic**: 
   - If `x > y`, return -1 (invalid range)
   - If `y` is even, return `y` (it's the largest even number in the range)
   - If `y` is odd, check if `y-1 >= x`. If so, return `y-1`, otherwise return -1

3. **Preconditions**: The documentation states "positive numbers", so we should require `x > 0` and `y > 0`.

4. **Postconditions**: 
   - If result is -1, then there's no even number in range [x, y]
   - If result is not -1, then result is even, in range [x, y], and is the maximum such even number
   - The result correctly implements the algorithm logic

5. **No loops or recursion**: This is a straightforward conditional algorithm, so no invariants or decreases clauses needed.

```dafny
method choose_num(x: int, y: int) returns (result: int)
    requires x > 0 && y > 0
    ensures result == -1 <==> (forall i :: x <= i <= y ==> i % 2 != 0)
    ensures result != -1 ==> (result % 2 == 0 && x <= result <= y)
    ensures result != -1 ==> (forall i :: x <= i <= y && i % 2 == 0 ==> i <= result)
{
    if x > y {
        result := -1;
    } else if y % 2 == 0 {
        result := y;
    } else if y - 1 >= x {
        result := y - 1;
    } else {
        result := -1;
    }
}
```
