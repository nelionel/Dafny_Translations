=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    """This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the
    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If 
    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.

    For example:
    choose_num(12, 15) = 14
    choose_num(13, 12) = -1
    """
    # If x > y, the range is invalid
    if x > y:
        return -1
    
    # Start from y and find the largest even number
    if y % 2 == 0:
        # y is even, so it's our answer
        return y
    else:
        # y is odd, check if y-1 is in range
        if y - 1 >= x:
            return y - 1
        else:
            # No even number in range
            return -1
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
method choose_num(x: int, y: int) returns (result: int)
    requires x > 0 && y > 0
    ensures result == -1 <==> (forall i :: x <= i <= y ==> i % 2 != 0)
    ensures result != -1 ==> (result % 2 == 0 && x <= result <= y)
    ensures result != -1 ==> (forall i :: x <= i <= y && i % 2 == 0 ==> i <= result)
{
    if x > y {
        result := -1;
    } else if y % 2 == 0 {
        result := y;
    } else if y - 1 >= x {
        result := y - 1;
    } else {
        result := -1;
    }
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function and Dafny specifications:

**Python function behavior:**
1. Takes two positive numbers x and y
2. Returns the biggest even integer in range [x, y] inclusive
3. If no such number exists, returns -1
4. If x > y, returns -1

**Current Dafny specifications:**
1. `requires x > 0 && y > 0` - requires both inputs to be positive
2. `ensures result == -1 <==> (forall i :: x <= i <= y ==> i % 2 != 0)` - result is -1 iff all numbers in range are odd
3. `ensures result != -1 ==> (result % 2 == 0 && x <= result <= y)` - if result is not -1, then it's even and in range
4. `ensures result != -1 ==> (forall i :: x <= i <= y && i % 2 == 0 ==> i <= result)` - if result is not -1, then it's the maximum even number in range

Let me check if these specifications are correct:

1. The precondition looks correct - the Python function expects positive numbers.

2. The first ensures clause says result == -1 iff all numbers in range are odd. But this is not quite right. The result is -1 in two cases:
   - x > y (invalid range)
   - All numbers in range [x, y] are odd
   
   The current specification doesn't account for the x > y case.

3. The second ensures clause says if result != -1, then result is even and in range. This looks correct.

4. The third ensures clause says if result != -1, then result is the maximum even number in range. This looks correct.

The main issue is with the first ensures clause. It doesn't properly handle the case where x > y. In that case, result == -1 but it's not because all numbers in range are odd - it's because there's no valid range.
 
I'll refine the specification to capture both scenarios precisely. The corrected version explicitly handles both conditions: an invalid range or a range with only odd numbers. This ensures the specification accurately reflects the function's intended behavior, covering edge cases like invalid input ranges and ranges without even numbers.

This is attempt 2 to improve the specifications. Please analyze the current version and improve it further if needed.

Let me analyze the Python function and the Dafny specifications carefully.

Python function behavior:
1. Takes two positive numbers x and y
2. Returns the biggest even integer in the range [x, y] inclusive
3. If there's no such number, returns -1
4. If x > y, returns -1 (invalid range)

Let me trace through the logic:
- If x > y: return -1
- If y is even: return y (since y is the largest number in range, and it's even)
- If y is odd: check if y-1 >= x. If yes, return y-1 (which is even). If no, return -1.

Now let's check the Dafny specifications:

```dafny
requires x > 0 && y > 0
ensures result == -1 <==> (x > y || (forall i :: x <= i <= y ==> i % 2 != 0))
ensures result != -1 ==> (result % 2 == 0 && x <= result <= y)
ensures result != -1 ==> (forall i :: x <= i <= y && i % 2 == 0 ==> i <= result)
```

Let me check each specification:

1. `requires x > 0 && y > 0` - The Python docstring says "two positive numbers x and y", so this seems correct.

2. `ensures result == -1 <==> (x > y || (forall i :: x <= i <= y ==> i % 2 != 0))`
   This says result is -1 if and only if either x > y OR all numbers in [x,y] are odd.
   This seems correct - we return -1 when the range is invalid (x > y) or when there are no even numbers in the range.

3. `ensures result != -1 ==> (result % 2 == 0 && x <= result <= y)`
   This says if result is not -1, then result is even and within the range [x,y].
   This seems correct.

4. `ensures result != -1 ==> (forall i :: x <= i <= y && i % 2 == 0 ==> i <= result)`
   This says if result is not -1, then result is greater than or equal to all even numbers in the range [x,y].
   This captures that result is the maximum even number in the range.

I'll verify the specification covers different scenarios. The conditions ensure the function returns the largest even number within the given positive range, or -1 if no such number exists. The logic handles edge cases like invalid ranges or ranges with no even numbers systematically.

When y is odd and y-1 falls outside the range, the function correctly identifies that no even numbers are present. The universal quantifier in the ensures clause elegantly captures this constraint, guaranteeing the result meets the specified conditions across all possible input scenarios.

The specification precisely defines the function's behavior through three key conditions. First, it determines when to return -1, which occurs either when the range is invalid or when every number in the range is odd. Second, it ensures that when a valid result exists, the returned value is an even number within the specified range. Third, it confirms that the returned even number represents the maximum possible value in that range.

These clauses comprehensively describe the function's logic, handling edge cases and defining precise output requirements with mathematical rigor.

The examples validate the specification's correctness, demonstrating how the function handles various input scenarios - from ranges with no valid even numbers to ranges with multiple even numbers, and including invalid range conditions.

Looking at the Python function and the Dafny specifications:

The Python function:
1. Takes two positive numbers x and y
2. Returns the largest even integer in range [x, y] inclusive
3. Returns -1 if x > y or if no even number exists in the range

Let me analyze the Dafny specifications:

1. `requires x > 0 && y > 0` - Correctly captures that x and y are positive
2. `ensures result == -1 <==> (x > y || (forall i :: x <= i <= y ==> i % 2 != 0))` - Correctly captures when -1 is returned (invalid range or no even numbers)
3. `ensures result != -1 ==> (result % 2 == 0 && x <= result <= y)` - Correctly ensures valid result is even and in range
4. `ensures result != -1 ==> (forall i :: x <= i <= y && i % 2 == 0 ==> i <= result)` - Correctly ensures result is the maximum even number in range

These specifications fully capture the function's behavior: they specify when -1 is returned, and when a valid result is returned, they ensure it's the largest even number in the valid range.

THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS

```dafny
method choose_num(x: int, y: int) returns (result: int)
    requires x > 0 && y > 0
    ensures result == -1 <==> (x > y || (forall i :: x <= i <= y ==> i % 2 != 0))
    ensures result != -1 ==> (result % 2 == 0 && x <= result <= y)
    ensures result != -1 ==> (forall i :: x <= i <= y && i % 2 == 0 ==> i <= result)
{
    if x > y {
        result := -1;
    } else if y % 2 == 0 {
        result := y;
    } else if y - 1 >= x {
        result := y - 1;
    } else {
        result := -1;
    }
}
```
