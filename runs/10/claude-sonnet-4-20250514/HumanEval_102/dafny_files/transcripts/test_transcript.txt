=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `choose_num`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python
def check(candidate):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert candidate(12, 15) == 14
    assert candidate(13, 12) == -1
    assert candidate(33, 12354) == 12354
    assert candidate(5234, 5233) == -1
    assert candidate(6, 29) == 28
    assert candidate(27, 10) == -1

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert candidate(7, 7) == -1
    assert candidate(546, 546) == 546


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method choose_num(x: int, y: int) returns (result: int)
    requires x > 0 && y > 0
    ensures result == -1 <==> (forall i :: x <= i <= y ==> i % 2 != 0)
    ensures result != -1 ==> (result % 2 == 0 && x <= result <= y)
    ensures result != -1 ==> (forall i :: x <= i <= y && i % 2 == 0 ==> i <= result)
{
    if x > y {
        result := -1;
    } else if y % 2 == 0 {
        result := y;
    } else if y - 1 >= x {
        result := y - 1;
    } else {
        result := -1;
    }
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`choose_num`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `choose_num` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `choose_num` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the provided Dafny solution to understand the signature of `choose_num`:

```dafny
method choose_num(x: int, y: int) returns (result: int)
    requires x > 0 && y > 0
    ensures result == -1 <==> (forall i :: x <= i <= y ==> i % 2 != 0)
    ensures result != -1 ==> (result % 2 == 0 && x <= result <= y)
    ensures result != -1 ==> (forall i :: x <= i <= y && i % 2 == 0 ==> i <= result)
{
    if x > y {
        result := -1;
    } else if y % 2 == 0 {
        result := y;
    } else if y - 1 >= x {
        result := y - 1;
    } else {
        result := -1;
    }
}
```

So it's a method that takes two integers x and y, has precondition that both are positive, and returns an integer.

For the dummy implementation, I need to create a method with the same signature but without the preconditions and postconditions, and just return a default value (0 for int).

Now let's translate the Python tests:

```python
assert candidate(12, 15) == 14
assert candidate(13, 12) == -1
assert candidate(33, 12354) == 12354
assert candidate(5234, 5233) == -1
assert candidate(6, 29) == 28
assert candidate(27, 10) == -1
assert candidate(7, 7) == -1
assert candidate(546, 546) == 546
```

Each of these will become a test method that calls `choose_num` and uses `expect` to check the result.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the Dafny solution code, I can see that `choose_num` is a method that takes two integers and returns an integer.

<dummy>
method choose_num(x: int, y: int) returns (result: int)
{
    result := 0;
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := choose_num(12, 15);
    expect result == 14;
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := choose_num(13, 12);
    expect result == -1;
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := choose_num(33, 12354);
    expect result == 12354;
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := choose_num(5234, 5233);
    expect result == -1;
}

method {:test} test_4()
{
    var result := choose_num(6, 29);
    expect result == 28;
}

method {:test} test_5()
{
    var result := choose_num(27, 10);
    expect result == -1;
}

method {:test} test_6()
{
    var result := choose_num(7, 7);
    expect result == -1;
}

method {:test} test_7()
{
    var result := choose_num(546, 546);
    expect result == 546;
}
```
