You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def choose_num(x, y):
    """This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the
    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If 
    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.

    For example:
    choose_num(12, 15) = 14
    choose_num(13, 12) = -1
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to find the largest even integer in the range [x, y] inclusive, or return -1 if no such number exists.

Let me break down the approach:
1. First check if the range is valid (x ≤ y)
2. Start from the upper bound y and work backwards to find the first even number
3. If y is even, that's our answer
4. If y is odd, check if y-1 is still within the range and ≥ x

```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    """This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the
    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If 
    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.

    For example:
    choose_num(12, 15) = 14
    choose_num(13, 12) = -1
    """
    # If x > y, the range is invalid
    if x > y:
        return -1
    
    # Start from y and find the largest even number
    if y % 2 == 0:
        # y is even, so it's our answer
        return y
    else:
        # y is odd, check if y-1 is in range
        if y - 1 >= x:
            return y - 1
        else:
            # No even number in range
            return -1
```

The function works as follows:
- If x > y, return -1 (invalid range)
- If y is even, return y (largest even number in range)
- If y is odd, check if y-1 is still ≥ x:
  - If yes, return y-1 (largest even number in range)
  - If no, return -1 (no even number exists in range)

This handles all cases including when the range contains no even numbers (like when x and y are the same odd number).
