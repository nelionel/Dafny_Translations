You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def unique_digits(x):
    """Given a list of positive integers x. return a sorted list of all 
    elements that hasn't any even digit.

    Note: Returned list should be sorted in increasing order.
    
    For example:
    >>> unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1])
    [1, 15, 33]
    >>> unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10])
    []
    """

def unique_digits(x):
    """Given a list of positive integers x. return a sorted list of all 
    elements that hasn't any even digit.

    Note: Returned list should be sorted in increasing order.
    
    For example:
    >>> unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1])
    [1, 15, 33]
    >>> unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10])
    []
    """
    def has_only_odd_digits(num):
        """Check if a number contains only odd digits"""
        for digit_char in str(num):
            digit = int(digit_char)
            if digit % 2 == 0:  # even digit found
                return False
        return True
    
    # Filter numbers that have only odd digits and sort the result
    result = [num for num in x if has_only_odd_digits(num)]
    return sorted(result)
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `unique_digits`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Function analysis:**
   - Input: `x` - a list of positive integers
   - Output: a sorted list of integers that contain only odd digits
   - Logic: For each number in the input list, check if all its digits are odd. If so, include it in the result. Then sort the result.

2. **Type mapping:**
   - Python `list[int]` → Dafny `seq<int>`
   - Return type is also `seq<int>`

3. **Helper function analysis:**
   - `has_only_odd_digits(num)`: checks if a number has only odd digits
   - This iterates through the string representation of the number and checks each digit

4. **Dafny implementation considerations:**
   - I need to implement a helper function to check if a number has only odd digits
   - I need to filter the sequence and then sort it
   - For the helper function, I'll need to extract digits from a number
   - I'll need to implement sorting

5. **Pre-conditions and post-conditions:**
   - Pre-condition: input sequence should contain positive integers (though the function doesn't explicitly check this)
   - Post-condition: 
     - All elements in the result have only odd digits
     - The result is sorted in ascending order
     - All elements in the result were in the original input

6. **Loops and invariants:**
   - The digit checking will need a loop with invariants
   - The filtering process might need invariants
   - Sorting will need its own implementation with invariants

Let me implement this step by step:

First, I need a helper to extract digits and check if they're all odd.
Then I need to filter the sequence.
Finally, I need to sort the result.

For extracting digits, I can use integer division and modulo operations.

Let me write the Dafny code:

   - Filter the sequence based on the predicate
   - Sort the filtered result

5. **Pre/post conditions:**
   - Pre-condition: input should be a sequence of integers
   - Post-condition: result is sorted and contains only numbers with odd digits from the input
