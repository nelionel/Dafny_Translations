def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd
    integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.

    Example 1:

        Input: 3
        Output: (1, 2)
        Explanation:
        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even, and two of them are odd.

    Example 2:

        Input: 12
        Output: (4, 6)
        Explanation:
        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and 6 of them are odd.

    Note:
        1. 1 <= n <= 10^3
        2. returned tuple has the number of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.

======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Find all palindromic numbers in the range [1, n]
2. Count how many are even and how many are odd
3. Return a tuple (even_count, odd_count)

A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. For numbers, this means the string representation should be the same when reversed.

```python
def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    """

    integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.

    """
    def is_palindrome(num):
        """Check if a number is a palindrome"""
        str_num = str(num)
        return str_num == str_num[::-1]
    
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Check each number from 1 to n (inclusive)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if is_palindrome(i):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                even_count += 1
            else:
                odd_count += 1
    
    return (even_count, odd_count)
```

The solution works as follows:

1. **Helper function `is_palindrome(num)`**: Converts the number to a string and checks if it reads the same forwards and backwards using string slicing (`[::-1]`)

2. **Main logic**: 
   - Initialize counters for even and odd palindromes
   - Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive)
   - For each number that is a palindrome, check if it's even or odd using modulo operator
   - Increment the appropriate counter
   - Return the tuple with (even_count, odd_count)

For the examples:
- Input 3: Palindromes are [1, 2, 3]. Even: [2] (count=1), Odd: [1, 3] (count=2) → (1, 2)
- Input 12: Palindromes are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11]. Even: [2, 4, 6, 8] (count=4), Odd: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11] (count=6) → (4, 6)
