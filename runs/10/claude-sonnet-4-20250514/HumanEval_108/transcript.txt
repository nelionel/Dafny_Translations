======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def count_nums(arr):
    """
    Write a function count_nums which takes an array of integers and returns
    the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.
    If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:
    e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.
    >>> count_nums([]) == 0
    >>> count_nums([-1, 11, -11]) == 1
    >>> count_nums([1, 1, 2]) == 3
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. For each number in the array, calculate the sum of its digits
2. For negative numbers, only the first digit is negative
3. Count how many numbers have a positive sum of digits

Let me trace through the examples:
- `[]` → 0 (empty array)
- `[-1, 11, -11]` → 1 (only 11 has positive digit sum: 1+1=2)
  - -1: sum = -1 (not > 0)
  - 11: sum = 1+1 = 2 (> 0) ✓
  - -11: sum = -1+1 = 0 (not > 0)
- `[1, 1, 2]` → 3 (all have positive digit sums)

```python
def count_nums(arr):
    """
