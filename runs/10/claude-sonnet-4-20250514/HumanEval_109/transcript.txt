    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order using only right shift operations.

Let me analyze what a right shift operation does:
- It moves all elements one position to the right
- The last element wraps around to the first position
- This is essentially a rotation of the array

The key insight is that if an array can be sorted by right shifts, then the sorted version of the array must be one of the possible rotations of the original array.

Here's my approach:
1. If the array is empty, return True
2. Get the sorted version of the array
3. Check if the sorted array can be obtained by rotating the original array
4. This means checking if the sorted array appears as a contiguous sequence when we concatenate the original array with itself

```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    """We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
    the following operation on the given array:
        You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.
    
    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
    position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

    If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
    then return True else return False.
    If the given array is empty then return True.

    Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.
    """
    
    # If array is empty, return True
    if not arr:
        return True
    
    # Get the sorted version of the array
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
    
    # Check if sorted_arr is a rotation of arr
    # We do this by checking if sorted_arr appears in arr + arr
    arr_doubled = arr + arr
    
    # Convert to strings to use string matching (easier than list matching)
    sorted_str = str(sorted_arr)
    doubled_str = str(arr_doubled)
    
    # Check if the sorted array appears as a contiguous subsequence
    # in the doubled array
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr_doubled[i:i+n] == sorted_arr:
            return True
    
    return False
```

Wait, let me refine this approach. The string conversion might not work reliably. Let me use a more direct approach:

```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    """We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing

    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
    position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

    If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
    then return True else return False.
    If the given array is empty then return True.

    Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

    # Check if sorted_arr is a rotation of arr
    # Try all possible rotations of arr
    n = len(arr)
    
    for i in range(n):
        # Create rotation: take elements from position i to end, then from start to i-1
        rotated = arr[i:] + arr[:i]
        if rotated == sorted_arr:
            return True
    
    return False
