=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python
from typing import List


def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Input are two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    Perform binary XOR on these inputs and return result also as a string.
    >>> string_xor('010', '110')
    '100'
    """

def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Input are two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    Perform binary XOR on these inputs and return result also as a string.
    >>> string_xor('010', '110')
    '100'
    """
    result = ""
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            result += "0"
        else:
            result += "1"
    return result
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `string_xor`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python code first:

1. The function `string_xor` takes two strings `a` and `b` consisting only of '1' and '0' characters.
2. It performs XOR operation on each character position:
   - If characters at position i are the same, result gets '0'
   - If characters at position i are different, result gets '1'
3. It returns the result as a string.

For mapping to Dafny:
- Python `str` maps to Dafny `string`
- The function signature will be: `method string_xor(a: string, b: string) returns (result: string)`

Pre-conditions:
- Both strings should have the same length
- Both strings should consist only of '0' and '1' characters

Post-conditions:
- The result string should have the same length as input strings
- Each character in result should be '0' or '1'
- The XOR logic should be correct: result[i] == '0' iff a[i] == b[i]

For the loop:
- Loop invariant: 
  - The result built so far has correct XOR values
  - The length of result equals the current index
  - All characters in result are '0' or '1'

Let me write the Dafny code:

```dafny
method string_xor(a: string, b: string) returns (result: string)
    requires |a| == |b|
    requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> (a[i] == '0' || a[i] == '1')
    requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |b| ==> (b[i] == '0' || b[i] == '1')
    ensures |result| == |a|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> (result[i] == '0' || result[i] == '1')
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> 
        (result[i] == '0' <==> a[i] == b[i])
{
    result := "";
    var i := 0;
    while i < |a|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |a|
        invariant |result| == i
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> (result[j] == '0' || result[j] == '1')
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> (result[j] == '0' 

I'll continue the partial thought by copying over the next thinking to complete it:

        <==> a[j] == b[j])
    {
        var xor_char := if a[i] == b[i] then '0' else '1';
        result := result + xor_char;
        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

The rewritten thinking focuses on the key aspects of completing the XOR function implementation in Dafny, highlighting the core logic and verification conditions.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python code:

1. **Function Logic**: The `string_xor` function takes two strings `a` and `b` containing only '0' and '1' characters, and performs XOR on each character position. If characters are the same, result gets '0', otherwise '1'.

2. **Type Mapping**: Python `str` maps to Dafny `string`.

3. **Pre-conditions**: 
   - Both strings must have the same length (implicit in Python code since it uses `range(len(a))`)
   - Both strings should contain only '0' and '1' characters

4. **Post-conditions**:
   - Result string has same length as inputs
   - Result contains only '0' and '1' characters  
   - XOR logic: result[i] == '0' iff a[i] == b[i]

5. **Loop Analysis**: The for loop iterates through indices, building result character by character. Loop invariant should maintain that the partial result built so far follows XOR logic.

6. **Termination**: The loop runs for a fixed number of iterations (length of string), so `decreases |a| - i` works.
