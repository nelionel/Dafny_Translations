from typing import List


def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Input are two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    Perform binary XOR on these inputs and return result also as a string.
    >>> string_xor('010', '110')
    '100'
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to perform XOR operation on two binary strings character by character and return the result as a string.

XOR logic:
- 0 XOR 0 = 0
- 0 XOR 1 = 1
- 1 XOR 0 = 1
- 1 XOR 1 = 0

```python
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Input are two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    Perform binary XOR on these inputs and return result also as a string.
    >>> string_xor('010', '110')
    '100'
    """
    result = ""
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            result += "0"
        else:
            result += "1"
    return result
```

The function works by:
1. Iterating through each character position in both strings
2. If the characters at the same position are the same (both '0' or both '1'), XOR results in '0'
3. If the characters are different (one '0' and one '1'), XOR results in '1'
4. Building the result string character by character

For the example `string_xor('010', '110')`:
- Position 0: '0' XOR '1' = '1'
- Position 1: '1' XOR '1' = '0'
- Position 2: '0' XOR '0' = '0'
- Result: '100'
