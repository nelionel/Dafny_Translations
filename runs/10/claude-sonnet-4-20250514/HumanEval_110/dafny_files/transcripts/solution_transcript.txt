You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    """In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,
    and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements
    between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
    There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
    all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".
    Otherwise, return "NO".
    For example:
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "YES"
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"
    It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.

            total_even += 1
    
    # Count even numbers in lst2

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `exchange`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function step by step:

1. **Function analysis**:
   - Takes two lists of numbers (`lst1`, `lst2`)
   - Returns "YES" or "NO" (string)
   - The goal is to determine if we can exchange elements between the lists to make `lst1` contain only even numbers
   - The key insight is that we need to count the total number of even numbers in both lists combined
   - If the total even numbers >= length of lst1, then we can make lst1 all even, otherwise not

2. **Type mapping**:
   - Python lists of numbers → Dafny `seq<int>` (assuming integers for simplicity)
   - Python strings "YES"/"NO" → Dafny `string`

3. **Logic**:
   - Count even numbers in lst1
   - Count even numbers in lst2
   - If total_even >= len(lst1), return "YES", else "NO"

4. **Pre-conditions**:
   - The input lists are non-empty (as stated in documentation)

5. **Post-conditions**:
   - The result is either "YES" or "NO"
   - Result is "YES" iff total even numbers >= length of lst1

6. **Loop invariants**:
   - We have loops to count even numbers, so we need invariants about the counting process

Let me write the Dafny code:

```dafny
method exchange(lst1: seq<int>, lst2: seq<int>) returns (result: string)
  requires |lst1| > 0 && |lst2| > 0  // non-empty lists
  ensures result == "YES" || result == "NO"
  ensures result == "YES" <==> (countEven(lst1) + countEven(lst2) >= |lst1|)
{
  var totalEven := 0;
  
  I'll count the even numbers in the first list systematically. The goal is to track how many even numbers exist in lst1. I'll use a while loop to iterate through each element, incrementing the total even count when an even number is found. The loop maintains an invariant tracking the current count of even numbers up to the current index. This approach ensures a precise count of even numbers in the first list.

  // Count even numbers in lst2
  i := 0;
  while i < |lst2|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |lst2|
    invariant total
```

I'll complete the partial thought by copying over the next thinking up to the next logical break. The previous thought was cut off mid-sentence about the loop invariant for counting even numbers in lst2.

Even == countEven(lst1) + countEvenUpTo(lst2, i)
  {
    if lst2[i] % 2 == 0 {
      totalEven := totalEven + 1;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  
  I'll now check if the total number of even numbers meets the condition. If the count of even numbers is greater than or equal to the length of lst1, I'll set the result to "YES". Otherwise, I'll set it to "NO".

  The recursive functions will need careful handling to ensure proper termination and counting of even numbers across different sequences.
