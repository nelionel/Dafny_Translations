=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    """In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,
    and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements
    between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
    There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
    all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".
    Otherwise, return "NO".
    For example:
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "YES"
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"
    It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.
    """
    # Count total even numbers in both lists
    total_even = 0
    
    # Count even numbers in lst1
    for num in lst1:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            total_even += 1
    
    # Count even numbers in lst2
    for num in lst2:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            total_even += 1
    
    # If we have enough even numbers to fill lst1, return "YES"
    if total_even >= len(lst1):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
method exchange(lst1: seq<int>, lst2: seq<int>) returns (result: string)
  requires |lst1| > 0 && |lst2| > 0  // non-empty lists as stated in documentation
  ensures result == "YES" || result == "NO"
  ensures result == "YES" <==> (countEven(lst1) + countEven(lst2) >= |lst1|)
{
  var totalEven := 0;
  
  // Count even numbers in lst1
  var i := 0;
  while i < |lst1|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |lst1|
    invariant totalEven == countEvenUpTo(lst1, i)
  {
    if lst1[i] % 2 == 0 {
      totalEven := totalEven + 1;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  
  // Count even numbers in lst2
  i := 0;
  while i < |lst2|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |lst2|
    invariant totalEven == countEven(lst1) + countEvenUpTo(lst2, i)
  {
    if lst2[i] % 2 == 0 {
      totalEven := totalEven + 1;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  
  if totalEven >= |lst1| {
    result := "YES";
  } else {
    result := "NO";
  }
}

function countEven(s: seq<int>): int
  decreases |s|
{
  if |s| == 0 then 0
  else (if s[0] % 2 == 0 then 1 else 0) + countEven(s[1..])
}

function countEvenUpTo(s: seq<int>, n: int): int
  requires 0 <= n <= |s|
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 then 0
  else (if s[n-1] % 2 == 0 then 1 else 0) + countEvenUpTo(s, n-1)
}

lemma CountEvenUpToComplete(s: seq<int>)
  ensures countEvenUpTo(s, |s|) == countEven(s)
{
  if |s| == 0 {
    // Base case: both functions return 0 for empty sequence
  } else {
    // Inductive case
    CountEvenUpToComplete(s[1..]);
    assert countEvenUpTo(s, |s|) == (if s[|s|-1] % 2 == 0 then 1 else 0) + countEvenUpTo(s, |s|-1);
    assert countEven(s) == (if s[0] % 2 == 0 then 1 else 0) + countEven(s[1..]);
  }
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function and Dafny specifications carefully.

**Python Function Analysis:**
1. Takes two lists (lst1, lst2)
2. Counts total even numbers in both lists combined
3. If total even numbers >= len(lst1), returns "YES", otherwise "NO"
4. The goal is to determine if we can exchange elements to make lst1 contain only even numbers
5. Documentation states input lists will be non-empty

**Dafny Specifications Analysis:**

```dafny
requires |lst1| > 0 && |lst2| > 0  // non-empty lists as stated in documentation
ensures result == "YES" || result == "NO"
ensures result == "YES" <==> (countEven(lst1) + countEven(lst2) >= |lst1|)
```

Let me check if these specifications are correct:

1. `requires |lst1| > 0 && |lst2| > 0` - This correctly captures that both lists are non-empty, as stated in the Python documentation.

2. `ensures result == "YES" || result == "NO"` - This correctly captures that the result is one of these two strings.

3. `ensures result == "YES" <==> (countEven(lst1) + countEven(lst2) >= |lst1|)` - This is the key specification. Let me verify this matches the Python logic:

Python logic:
- Count total even numbers in both lists
- If total_even >= len(lst1), return "YES", else "NO"

Dafny logic:
- result == "YES" if and only if (countEven(lst1) + countEven(lst2) >= |lst1|)

This looks correct. The countEven function counts even numbers in a sequence, and countEven(lst1) + countEven(lst2) gives the total count of even numbers in both lists. The condition >= |lst1| matches the Python condition >= len(lst1).


I'll examine the helper functions and their implementation details. The `countEven` function uses recursion to count even numbers in a sequence, while `countEvenUpTo` tracks even numbers up to a specific index. The lemma `CountEvenUpToComplete` ensures the correctness of loop invariants by proving that counting even numbers up to the full sequence length matches the total count of even numbers.

The implementation focuses on carefully tracking even numbers through loop invariants, ensuring the verification process can prove the algorithm's correctness systematically.

The specifications comprehensively define the function's behavior, establishing clear preconditions and postconditions that precisely capture the computational logic for determining whether a combined list meets the even number threshold.
