======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

======USER PROMPT======

def odd_count(lst):
    """Given a list of strings, where each string consists of only digits, return a list.
    Each element i of the output should be "the number of odd elements in the
    string i of the input." where all the i's should be replaced by the number
    of odd digits in the i'th string of the input.

    >>> odd_count(['1234567'])
    ["the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput."]
    >>> odd_count(['3',"11111111"])
    ["the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.",
     "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput."]
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Count the number of odd digits in each string
2. Create a template message where specific characters ('i') are replaced with the count of odd digits
3. Return a list of these formatted messages

Let me analyze the examples:
- For `'1234567'`: odd digits are 1, 3, 5, 7 (count = 4)
- The template seems to be "the number of odd elements in the string i of the input."
- All 'i' characters get replaced with the count (4)

```python
def odd_count(lst):
    """Given a list of strings, where each string consists of only digits, return a list.
    Each element i of the output should be "the number of odd elements in the
    string i of the input." where all the i's should be replaced by the number
    of odd digits in the i'th string of the input.

    >>> odd_count(['1234567'])
    ["the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput."]
    >>> odd_count(['3',"11111111"])
    ["the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.",
     "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput."]
    """
    result = []
    template = "the number of odd elements in the string i of the input."
    
    for string in lst:
        # Count odd digits in the current string
        odd_count = 0
        for char in string:
            if char.isdigit() and int(char) % 2 == 1:
                odd_count += 1
        
        # Replace all 'i' characters with the count
        formatted_string = template.replace('i', str(odd_count))
        result.append(formatted_string)
    
    return result
```
