You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def minSubArraySum(nums):
    """
    Given an array of integers nums, find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array
    of nums.
    Example
    minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]) == 1
    minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]) == -6
    """

def minSubArraySum(nums):
    """
    Given an array of integers nums, find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array
    of nums.
    Example

    minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]) == -6
    """
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize with the first element
    min_ending_here = nums[0]
    min_so_far = nums[0]
    
    # Iterate through the rest of the array
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        # Either extend the existing subarray or start a new one
        min_ending_here = min(nums[i], min_ending_here + nums[i])
        
        # Update the overall minimum
        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, min_ending_here)
    
    return min_so_far
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `minSubArraySum`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. The function `minSubArraySum` takes a list of integers and returns the minimum sum of any non-empty subarray.
2. It uses Kadane's algorithm variant for finding minimum subarray sum.
3. The function handles empty arrays by returning 0.
4. It initializes with the first element and then iterates through the rest.
5. For each element, it decides whether to extend the current subarray or start a new one.

For Dafny translation:

1. **Types**: Python list of integers â†’ Dafny `seq<int>`
2. **Preconditions**: The sequence should be non-empty (since we're looking for non-empty subarrays)
3. **Postconditions**: The result should be the minimum sum of all possible non-empty subarrays
4. **Loop invariants**: Need to track that `min_ending_here` is the minimum sum ending at current position, and `min_so_far` is the overall minimum found so far.

Let me think about the algorithm:
- We iterate through the array starting from index 1
- For each position, we maintain:
  - `min_ending_here`: minimum sum of subarray ending at current position
  - `min_so_far`: overall minimum sum found so far
- The loop invariant should ensure these properties are maintained

For termination: The loop runs from 1 to len(nums)-1, so it's clearly terminating.

The postcondition should ensure that the returned value is indeed the minimum sum of all possible non-empty subarrays. This is tricky to specify formally, but I can at least ensure it's less than or equal to any single element (since single elements are valid subarrays).

Wait, let me look at the Python code again. It returns 0 for empty arrays, but the docstring says we need non-empty subarrays. I think in Dafny I should require the sequence to be non-empty as a precondition.

--- RESPONSE ---
<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Function Logic**: This implements a variant of Kadane's algorithm to find the minimum sum subarray instead of maximum. It uses dynamic programming where `min_ending_here` tracks the minimum sum ending at the current position, and `min_so_far` tracks the overall minimum found.

2. **Types**: Python list of integers maps to Dafny `seq<int>`. The return type is `int`.

3. **Preconditions**: The sequence should be non-empty since we need non-empty subarrays. The Python code returns 0 for empty arrays, but the specification asks for non-empty subarrays.

4. **Postconditions**: The result should be the minimum sum among all possible non-empty subarrays. At minimum, it should be no greater than any single element in the array.

5. **Loop Analysis**: The loop runs from index 1 to len(nums)-1, so termination is guaranteed. The loop invariants should maintain:
   - `min_ending_here` represents the minimum sum of subarrays ending at current position
   - `min_so_far` represents the overall minimum sum found so far
   - Both values are valid minimum sums of some non-empty subarray

6. **Edge Cases**: Single element arrays should return that element.

method minSubArraySum(nums: seq<int>) returns (result: int)
    requires |nums| > 0

    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |nums| ==> result <= nums[i]  // At least as good as any single element

        }

        }
        
        i := i + 1;

    result := min_so_far;
