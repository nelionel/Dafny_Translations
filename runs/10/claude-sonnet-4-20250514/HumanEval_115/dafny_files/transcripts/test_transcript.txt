You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `max_fill`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python
def check(candidate):


    # Check some simple cases
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 1) == 6, "Error"
    assert candidate([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2) == 5, "Error"
    assert candidate([[0,0,0], [0,0,0]], 5) == 0, "Error"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate([[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]], 2) == 4, "Error"
    assert candidate([[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]], 9) == 2, "Error"


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method max_fill(grid: seq<seq<int>>, capacity: int) returns (total_trips: int)
    requires capacity > 0
    requires |grid| > 0
    requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |grid| ==> |grid[i]| > 0
    requires forall i, j :: 0 <= i < |grid| && 0 <= j < |grid[i]| ==> grid[i][j] == 0 || grid[i][j] == 1
    requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |grid| - 1 ==> |grid[i]| == |grid[i + 1]|  // all wells have same length
    ensures total_trips >= 0
{
    total_trips := 0;
    var i := 0;
    
    while i < |grid|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |grid|
        invariant total_trips >= 0
        decreases |grid| - i
    {
        var water_units := count_water_units(grid[i]);
        var trips_needed := if water_units > 0 then ceiling_division(water_units, capacity) else 0;
        total_trips := total_trips + trips_needed;
        i := i + 1;
    }
}

function count_water_units(row: seq<int>): int
    requires forall j :: 0 <= j < |row| ==> row[j] == 0 || row[j] == 1
    ensures count_water_units(row) >= 0
    ensures count_water_units(row) <= |row|
    decreases |row|
{
    if |row| == 0 then 0
    else row[0] + count_water_units(row[1..])
}

function ceiling_division(numerator: int, denominator: int): int
    requires denominator > 0
    requires numerator >= 0
    ensures ceiling_division(numerator, denominator) >= 0
    ensures numerator == 0 ==> ceiling_division(numerator, denominator) == 0
    ensures numerator > 0 ==> ceiling_division(numerator, denominator) > 0
    ensures ceiling_division(numerator, denominator) * denominator >= numerator
    ensures (ceiling_division(numerator, denominator) - 1) * denominator < numerator || numerator == 0
{
    if numerator == 0 then 0
    else (numerator + denominator - 1) / denominator
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`max_fill`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `max_fill` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `max_fill` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python test code and the Dafny solution.

From the Python tests, I can see that `candidate` is being called with:
1. `candidate([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 1) == 6`
2. `candidate([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2) == 5`
3. `candidate([[0,0,0], [0,0,0]], 5) == 0`
4. `candidate([[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]], 2) == 4`
5. `candidate([[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]], 9) == 2`

From the Dafny solution, I can see the method signature is:
`method max_fill(grid: seq<seq<int>>, capacity: int) returns (total_trips: int)`

So I need to create:
1. A dummy implementation with the same signature
2. Test methods that call max_fill with the test cases and use expect to check the results

Let me create the dummy first:
```dafny
method max_fill(grid: seq<seq<int>>, capacity: int) returns (total_trips: int)
    requires capacity > 0
    requires |grid| > 0
    requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |grid| ==> |grid[i]| > 0
    requires forall i, j :: 0 <= i < |grid| && 0 <= j < |grid[i]| ==> grid[i][j] == 0 || grid[i][j] == 1
    requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |grid| - 1 ==> |grid[i]| == |grid[i + 1]|
    ensures total_trips >= 0
{
    total_trips := 0;
}
```

I'll initialize a basic implementation that meets the method's preconditions and ensures a non-negative return value. The dummy method simply returns 0 for now, which satisfies the basic requirements of the problem.

The test cases suggest a function that calculates trips based on a grid and some parameter. I'll need to analyze the input matrix and trip constraints carefully to develop a robust solution.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the Python tests and the Dafny solution, I can see that `max_fill` takes a grid (seq<seq<int>>) and a capacity (int) and returns total_trips (int).

<dummy>
method max_fill(grid: seq<seq<int>>, capacity: int) returns (total_trips: int)
    requires capacity > 0
    requires |grid| > 0
    requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |grid| ==> |grid[i]| > 0
    requires forall i, j :: 0 <= i < |grid| && 0 <= j < |grid[i]| ==> grid[i][j] == 0 || grid[i][j] == 1
    requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |grid| - 1 ==> |grid[i]| == |grid[i + 1]|
    ensures total_trips >= 0
{
    total_trips := 0;
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := max_fill([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 1);
    expect result == 6;
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := max_fill([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2);
    expect result == 5;
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := max_fill([[0,0,0], [0,0,0]], 5);
    expect result == 0;
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := max_fill([[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]], 2);
    expect result == 4;
}

method {:test} test_4()
{
    var result := max_fill([[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]], 9);
    expect result == 2;
}
```
