def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    """
    You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,
    and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.
    Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, 
    and all buckets have the same capacity.
    Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.
    Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.

    Example 1:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]
            bucket_capacity : 1
        Output: 6

    Example 2:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]
            bucket_capacity : 2
        Output: 5
    
    Example 3:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]
            bucket_capacity : 5
        Output: 0

    Constraints:
        * all wells have the same length
        * 1 <= grid.length <= 10^2
        * 1 <= grid[:,1].length <= 10^2
        * grid[i][j] -> 0 | 1
        * 1 <= capacity <= 10
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Count the total water units in each well (each row)
2. For each well, calculate how many bucket trips are needed to empty it
3. Sum up all the bucket trips

Let me trace through the examples:

Example 1: 
- Row 0: [0,0,1,0] → 1 unit of water → ceil(1/1) = 1 trip
- Row 1: [0,1,0,0] → 1 unit of water → ceil(1/1) = 1 trip  
- Row 2: [1,1,1,1] → 4 units of water → ceil(4/1) = 4 trips
- Total: 1 + 1 + 4 = 6 trips

Example 2:
- Row 0: [0,0,1,1] → 2 units of water → ceil(2/2) = 1 trip
- Row 1: [0,0,0,0] → 0 units of water → ceil(0/2) = 0 trips
- Row 2: [1,1,1,1] → 4 units of water → ceil(4/2) = 2 trips
- Row 3: [0,1,1,1] → 3 units of water → ceil(3/2) = 2 trips
- Total: 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 = 5 trips
