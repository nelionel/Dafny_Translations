=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def sort_array(arr):
    """
    In this Kata, you have to sort an array of non-negative integers according to
    number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order.
    For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value.

    It must be implemented like this:
    >>> sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    >>> sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]) == [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]
    >>> sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4]) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    """

def sort_array(arr):
    """
    In this Kata, you have to sort an array of non-negative integers according to
    number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order.
    For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value.
    """
    def count_ones(n):
        # Count ones in binary representation of absolute value
        return bin(abs(n)).count('1')
    
    # Sort by: (number of ones in binary, decimal value)
    return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (count_ones(x), x))
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `sort_array`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze this Python function:

1. **Types**: The function takes a list of integers (both positive and negative) and returns a list of integers. In Dafny, this would be `seq<int>`.

2. **Logic**: The function sorts an array based on:
   - Primary key: Number of 1s in the binary representation of the absolute value
   - Secondary key: The decimal value itself
   
3. **Key functions**:
   - `count_ones(n)`: Counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of `abs(n)`
   - The main sorting uses a lambda that creates a tuple `(count_ones(x), x)`

4. **Pre-conditions**: None explicitly, but the array should be well-formed.

5. **Post-conditions**: 
   - The result should be a permutation of the input
   - The result should be sorted according to the specified criteria
   - The length should be preserved

Let me think about how to implement this in Dafny:

1. I need a helper function to count the number of 1s in binary representation
2. I need a comparison function that compares two integers based on the sorting criteria
3. I need to implement a sorting algorithm (I'll use a simple sorting algorithm)

For counting 1s in binary, I can use a recursive approach that repeatedly divides by 2 and counts the remainder.

For sorting, I can implement a simple insertion sort or bubble sort.

Let me draft the implementation:

```dafny
method sort_array(arr: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
    ensures |result| == |arr|
    ensures multiset(result) == multiset(arr)
    ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |result| ==> 
        (count_ones(abs(result[i])), result[i]) <= (count_ones(abs(result[j])), result[j])


{
    result := arr;
    
    // Implementing bubble sort with custom comparison
    var n := |result|;
    var i := 0;
    while i < n
        invariant 0 <= i <= n
        invariant |result| == n == |arr|
        invariant multiset(result) == multiset(arr)
    {
        var j := 0;
        while j < n - 1 - i
            invariant 0 <= j <= n - 1 - i
            invariant |result| == n == |arr|
            invariant multiset(result) == multiset(arr)
        {
            // Comparing elements based on number of 1s and then value
            if should_swap(result[j], result[j+1])
            {
                result := result[j := result[j+1]][j+1 := result[j]];
            }
            j := j + 1;
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
}

// Recursive function to count binary 1s in a number
function count_ones(n: int): int
    requires n >= 0
    decreases n
{
    if n == 0 then 0
    else (n % 2) + count_ones(n / 2)
}

// Predicate defining swap condition for sorting
predicate should_swap(a: int, b: int)
{
    var ones_a := count_ones(abs(a));
    var ones_b := count_ones(abs(b));
    ones_a > ones_b || (ones_a == ones_b && a > b)
}

I'll investigate the absolute value function's availability in Dafny.

I'll create a custom absolute value implementation to ensure compatibility. The Python sorting logic requires a specific comparison strategy: prioritize elements with fewer binary 1s, then smaller decimal values.

--- RESPONSE ---
<thinking>
Let me analyze this Python function:

1. **Types**: The function takes a list of integers and returns a list of integers. In Dafny, this maps to `seq<int>`.

2. **Logic**: The function sorts an array based on:
   - Primary key: Number of 1s in the binary representation of the absolute value  
   - Secondary key: The decimal value itself (ascending order)

3. **Key operations**:
   - `count_ones(n)`: Counts 1s in binary representation of `abs(n)`
   - Sorting using the tuple `(count_ones(x), x)` as the key

4. **Pre-conditions**: The input should be a valid sequence.

5. **Post-conditions**: 
   - Result has same length as input
   - Result is a permutation of input 
   - Result is sorted according to the specified criteria

For Dafny implementation:
1. Need helper function to count 1s in binary representation
2. Need helper function for absolute value
3. Need comparison predicate for the sorting criteria
4. Implement a sorting algorithm (bubble sort for simplicity)
5. Need proper loop invariants and termination conditions
