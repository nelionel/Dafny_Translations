You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def select_words(s, n):
    """Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement 
    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly 
    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
    Examples:
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
    select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
    select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
    select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]
    """

def select_words(s, n):
    """Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement 
    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly 
    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.

    select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
    select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]
    """
    if not s:
        return []
    
    words = s.split()
    result = []
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    
    for word in words:
        consonant_count = 0
        for char in word:
            if char.isalpha() and char not in vowels:
                consonant_count += 1
        
        if consonant_count == n:
            result.append(word)
    
    return result
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `select_words`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function step by step:

1. The function takes a string `s` and a natural number `n`
2. It returns a list of all words from string `s` that contain exactly `n` consonants
3. The words should be in the order they appear in the string
4. If the string is empty, return an empty list
5. The input string contains only letters and spaces

The logic:
1. Check if string is empty, return empty list if so
2. Split the string into words by spaces
3. For each word, count consonants (letters that are not vowels)
4. If consonant count equals n, add word to result
5. Return result

For Dafny:
- `s` will be of type `string`
- `n` will be of type `nat` (natural number)
- Return type will be `seq<string>` (sequence of strings)

I need to implement:
1. A function to check if a character is a vowel
2. A function to count consonants in a word
3. A function to split string by spaces
4. The main function

Let me think about the helper functions:

1. `IsVowel(c: char) -> bool`: checks if character is a vowel
2. `CountConsonants(word: string) -> nat`: counts consonants in a word
3. `SplitBySpaces(s: string) -> seq<string>`: splits string by spaces

For the main function:
- Requires: n >= 0 (natural number)
- Ensures: the result contains only words from the input string that have exactly n consonants

For loop invariants when iterating through words:
- The result so far contains only words with exactly n consonants
- All words processed so far have been checked

Let me implement this step by step.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python code:

1. **Types mapping:**
   - `s: string` → `s: string`
   - `n: natural number` → `n: nat`
   - Return type `list of strings` → `seq<string>`

2. **Function logic:**
   - Split string into words by spaces
   - For each word, count consonants (letters that are not vowels)
   - Keep words with exactly `n` consonants
   - Return in original order

3. **Pre/post-conditions:**
   - Requires: `n >= 0` (natural number)
   - Ensures: result contains only words from input with exactly `n` consonants

4. **Helper functions needed:**
   - `IsVowel(c: char) -> bool`
   - `CountConsonants(word: string) -> nat` 
   - `SplitBySpaces(s: string) -> seq<string>`

5. **Loop invariants:**
   - When processing words: result so far contains only valid words
   - When counting consonants: count is accurate for characters processed so far

6. **Termination:**
   - Loops terminate based on string/sequence lengths

--- THINKING ---
The error is occurring because I'm trying to call a method (`SplitBySpaces`) inside an `ensures` clause. In Dafny, ensures clauses can only contain pure expressions, not method calls. I need to either:

1. Convert `SplitBySpaces` to a function instead of a method, or
2. Remove that ensures clause and find a different way to specify the postcondition

Let me convert the helper methods to functions where possible, or remove problematic postconditions.

Actually, let me think about this differently. The ensures clause is trying to say that all words in the result come from the original string. But I can't call methods in ensures clauses. Let me simplify the postcondition or remove it entirely, since the correctness is more about the consonant counting logic.

Let me rewrite this with functions where possible:
