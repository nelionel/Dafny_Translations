You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

from typing import List, Optional


def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    """ Out of list of strings, return the longest one. Return the first one in case of multiple
    strings of the same length. Return None in case the input list is empty.
    >>> longest([])

    >>> longest(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'a'
    >>> longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc'])
    'ccc'
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this function, I need to:

1. Return `None` if the input list is empty
2. Find the longest string in the list
3. If there are multiple strings of the same maximum length, return the first one

Here's the implementation:

```python
from typing import List, Optional


def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    """ Out of list of strings, return the longest one. Return the first one in case of multiple
    strings of the same length. Return None in case the input list is empty.
    >>> longest([])

    >>> longest(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'a'
    >>> longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc'])
    'ccc'
    """
    if not strings:
        return None
    
    longest_string = strings[0]
    max_length = len(strings[0])
    
    for string in strings[1:]:
        if len(string) > max_length:
            max_length = len(string)
            longest_string = string
    
    return longest_string
```

The implementation works as follows:

1. First, I check if the input list is empty and return `None` if it is
2. I initialize `longest_string` with the first string and `max_length` with its length
3. I iterate through the remaining strings starting from index 1
4. For each string, if its length is greater than the current `max_length`, I update both `max_length` and `longest_string`
5. Finally, I return the longest string found

This ensures that in case of ties (multiple strings with the same maximum length), the first one encountered is returned.
