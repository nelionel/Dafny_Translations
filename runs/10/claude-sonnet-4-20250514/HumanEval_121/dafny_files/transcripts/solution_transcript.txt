=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def solution(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions.
    

    Examples
    solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12
    solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ==> 9
    solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) ==>0
    """

def solution(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions.
    

    Examples
    solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12
    solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ==> 9
    solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) ==>0
    """
    total = 0
    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):  # iterate through even positions (0, 2, 4, ...)
        if lst[i] % 2 == 1:  # check if the element is odd
            total += lst[i]
    return total
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `solution`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function step by step:

1. **Function Analysis:**
   - Input: A non-empty list of integers
   - Output: An integer (the sum)
   - Logic: Iterate through even positions (0, 2, 4, ...) and sum up only the odd numbers at those positions

2. **Type Mapping:**
   - Python `list` → Dafny `seq<int>`
   - Python `int` → Dafny `int`

3. **Pre-conditions:**
   - The list must be non-empty: `requires |lst| > 0`

4. **Post-conditions:**
   - The result should be the sum of odd elements at even positions
   - I need to define what this means formally

5. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop goes through indices 0, 2, 4, ... up to the length of the list
   - Loop invariant: `total` contains the sum of odd elements at even positions processed so far
   - Termination: The loop variable increases by 2 each time and is bounded by the length

6. **Implementation Details:**
   - I need to iterate through even indices
   - Check if the element at that index is odd
   - Add to total if it is

Let me write the Dafny code:

```dafny
method solution(lst: seq<int>) returns (result: int)
    requires |lst| > 0
    ensures result == SumOddAtEvenPositions(lst, 0)
{
    var total := 0;
    var i := 0;
    
    while i < |lst|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |lst|
        invariant i % 2 == 0
        invariant total == SumOddAtEvenPositions(lst, i)
        decreases |lst| - i
    {
        if lst[i] % 2 == 1 {
            total := total + lst[i];
        }
        i := i + 2;
    }
    
    result := total;
}

function SumOddAtEvenPositions(lst: seq<int>, upTo: int): int
    requires 0 <= upTo <= |lst|
    decreases upTo
{
    if upTo == 0 then 0
    else if upTo == 1 then
        if lst[0] % 2 == 1 then lst[0] else 0
    else
        var prevSum := SumOddAtEvenPositions(lst, upTo - 2

I'll continue the recursive function definition, focusing on the recursive case for calculating the sum of odd elements at even positions. The function will recursively compute the sum by checking the odd status of elements at even indices and accumulating the result. I'll recursively compute the sum of odd numbers at even indices, advancing by two positions each recursive call. The base case handles list exhaustion, while the recursive case checks if the current element is odd and adds it to the sum when appropriate. The function ensures we only process elements at even positions by incrementing the index by two in each recursive step.

4. **Post-conditions:**
   - The result should equal the sum of odd elements at even positions
   - I need a helper function to define this formally

5. **Loop Analysis:**
   - Loop iterates through even indices: 0, 2, 4, ...
   - Loop invariant: `total` contains sum of odd elements at even positions processed so far
   - Termination: loop index increases by 2 and is bounded by sequence length

6. **Implementation:**
   - Use a while loop with index starting at 0, incrementing by 2
   - Check if element at current index is odd (element % 2 == 1)
   - Add to running total if odd
