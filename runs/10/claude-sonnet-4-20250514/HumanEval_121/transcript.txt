======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def solution(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions.
    

    Examples
    solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12
    solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ==> 9
    solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) ==>0
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Find elements that are in even positions (0, 2, 4, etc.)
2. Among those elements, only consider the odd ones
3. Return the sum of those odd elements

Let me trace through the examples:
- `[5, 8, 7, 1]`: positions 0,2 have values 5,7. Both are odd. Sum = 5+7 = 12 ✓
- `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`: positions 0,2,4 have values 3,3,3. All are odd. Sum = 3+3+3 = 9 ✓  
- `[30, 13, 24, 321]`: positions 0,2 have values 30,24. Both are even. Sum = 0 ✓

```python
def solution(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions.
    

    Examples
    solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12
    solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ==> 9
    solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) ==>0
    """
    total = 0
    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):  # iterate through even positions (0, 2, 4, ...)
        if lst[i] % 2 == 1:  # check if the element is odd
            total += lst[i]
    return total
```
