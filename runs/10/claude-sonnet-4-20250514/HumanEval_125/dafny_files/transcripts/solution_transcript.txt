You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def split_words(txt):
    '''
    Given a string of words, return a list of words split on whitespace, if no whitespaces exists in the text you
    should split on commas ',' if no commas exists you should return the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the
    alphabet, ord('a') = 0, ord('b') = 1, ... ord('z') = 25
    Examples
    split_words("Hello world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
    split_words("Hello,world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
    split_words("abcdef") == 3 
    '''

def split_words(txt):
    '''
    Given a string of words, return a list of words split on whitespace, if no whitespaces exists in the text you
    should split on commas ',' if no commas exists you should return the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the
    alphabet, ord('a') = 0, ord('b') = 1, ... ord('z') = 25
    Examples
    split_words("Hello world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
    split_words("Hello,world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
    split_words("abcdef") == 3 
    '''
    # First, try to split on whitespace
    if ' ' in txt:
        return txt.split()
    
    # If no whitespace, try to split on commas
    if ',' in txt:
        return txt.split(',')
    
    # If neither whitespace nor commas, count lowercase letters with odd positions
    count = 0
    for char in txt:
        if char.islower() and char.isalpha():
            # Calculate position: a=0, b=1, c=2, etc.
            position = ord(char) - ord('a')
            # Check if position is odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25)
            if position % 2 == 1:
                count += 1
    
    return count
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `split_words`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function step by step:

1. The function `split_words` takes a string `txt` and returns either:
   - A list of strings if it contains whitespace or commas
   - An integer count if it contains neither

2. The logic is:
   - If the string contains a space, split on whitespace and return the list
   - If the string contains a comma (but no space), split on comma and return the list
   - Otherwise, count lowercase letters with odd positions in the alphabet (a=0, b=1, c=2, etc.) and return the count

The challenge here is that Python allows a function to return different types (list or int), but Dafny is strongly typed. I need to think about how to handle this.

Looking at the requirements, I need to use basic Dafny types. Since the function can return either a sequence of strings or an integer, I need to decide on a single return type.

One approach could be to use a union type or variant, but the requirements say I must use basic types only. 

Another approach is to change the interface slightly. But the requirements say the method name must be exactly the same.

Wait, let me re-read the requirements. It says "The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type." and lists options including sequences. 

I think the best approach is to create a method that returns a sequence of strings in all cases. When we need to return a count, we can return a sequence with a single string representation of the number.

Actually, let me think about this differently. The Python function has inconsistent return types, which is not directly translatable to Dafny. But looking at the examples:
- split_words("Hello world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
- split_words("Hello,world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]  
- split_words("abcdef") == 3

The third case returns an integer. In Dafny, I could potentially use a union type, but the requirements say to use basic types only.
 
I'm facing a dilemma with the inconsistent return types. The function sometimes returns a list of strings, and sometimes an integer count. This creates a challenge in Dafny's strongly typed environment. 

I'll explore ways to maintain the function's core logic while adhering to Dafny's type constraints. The key is finding a consistent return type that captures both the splitting and counting behaviors without losing the original function's essence.

The requirements provide some flexibility with basic types, but the mixed return types still pose a significant translation challenge. I need a solution that preserves the function's original behavior while meeting Dafny's type system requirements. I'm leaning towards a flexible return strategy that handles multiple input scenarios. The method will prioritize string splitting when whitespace or commas are present, and fall back to a count-based approach when those delimiters are absent. By converting the count to a string and wrapping it in a single-element sequence, I maintain a consistent return type of `seq<string>` across all cases. This approach balances the function's varied usage patterns while adhering to type constraints.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Function Logic**: The function has three cases:
   - If the string contains whitespace, split on whitespace and return a list of strings
   - If the string contains commas (but no whitespace), split on commas and return a list of strings  
   - Otherwise, count lowercase letters with odd alphabet positions and return an integer

2. **Type Challenge**: The Python function returns either a list of strings OR an integer, which creates a typing issue in Dafny since it's statically typed. According to the requirements, I must use basic Dafny types.

3. **Solution Approach**: Since 2 out of 3 cases return lists of strings, I'll make the return type consistently `seq<string>`. For the integer count case, I'll return a single-element sequence containing the string representation of the count.

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - Need helper methods for splitting on whitespace and commas
   - Need to implement the character counting logic
   - Need string conversion for the integer result
   - All helper methods need concrete implementations

5. **Specifications**: 
   - Input is always a valid string
   - Output is always a non-empty sequence of strings
   - Need loop invariants for the counting logic
