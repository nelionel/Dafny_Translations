=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    """You are given two intervals,
    where each interval is a pair of integers. For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).
    The given intervals are closed which means that the interval (start, end)
    includes both start and end.
    For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.
    Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two 
    intervals is a prime number.
    Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)
    which its length is 1, which not a prime number.
    If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return "YES",
    otherwise, return "NO".
    If the two intervals don't intersect, return "NO".


    [input/output] samples:
    intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> "NO"

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `intersection`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python code:

1. The function takes two intervals (tuples of integers)
2. It finds the intersection of these intervals
3. It calculates the length of the intersection
4. It checks if the length is a prime number
5. Returns "YES" if prime, "NO" otherwise

Key parts:
- Input: two tuples of integers representing intervals
- Output: string ("YES" or "NO")
- Helper function: is_prime(n) checks if a number is prime

For Dafny:
- I'll need to represent intervals as pairs (start, end) - I can use a tuple or just pass 4 separate parameters
- I'll need to implement the is_prime function
- I'll need to handle the intersection logic
- Return type will be string

Pre-conditions:
- Each interval should have start <= end (from the documentation)

Post-conditions:
- Returns "YES" if intersection length is prime, "NO" otherwise
- If no intersection, returns "NO"

Let me think about the structure:
1. I'll need a helper function is_prime
2. Main function intersection that takes two intervals
3. Calculate intersection bounds
4. Check if intersection exists
5. Calculate length and check if prime

For the is_prime function, I need to handle the loop with proper termination. The loop goes from 3 to sqrt(n), checking divisibility.

Let me implement this:

```dafny
function is_prime(n: int): bool
  requires n >= 0
  decreases n
{
  if n < 2 then false
  else if n == 2 then true
  else if n % 2 == 0 then false
  else is_prime_helper(n, 3)
}

function is_prime_helper(n: int, i: int): bool
  requires n >= 3
  requires i >= 3
  requires i % 2 == 1  // i is odd
  decreases n - i * i  // termination condition for square root check
{
  if i * i > n then true
  else if n % i == 0 then false
  else is_prime_helper(n, i + 2)
}

method intersection(start1: int, end1: int, start2: int, end2: int) returns (result: string)
  requires start1 <= end1
  requires start2 <= end2
  ensures result == "YES" || result == "NO"
{
  var intersection_start := if start1 > start2 then start1 else start2;
  var intersection_end := if end1 < end2 then end1 else end2;
  
  if intersection_start > intersection_end {
    result := "NO";
  } else {
    var intersection_length := intersection_end - intersection_start + 1;
    result := if is_prime(intersection_length) then "YES" else "NO";
  }
}

I'm considering interval representation alternatives and refining the prime checking approach. The termination logic for primality testing needs careful consideration around square root bounds.

A while loop might simplify the recursive implementation, allowing more direct control over iteration and termination conditions. The key challenge is designing a loop that efficiently checks primality without complex recursive mechanisms.

The decreases clause requires thoughtful selection to ensure proper termination, potentially using the relationship between the current divisor and the number being tested.

I'll explore an alternative approach to computing an approximate square root, focusing on a more straightforward method for primality testing that avoids recursive complexity.

The function uses a binary search strategy, systematically narrowing down the potential square root range. By recursively dividing the search interval and checking midpoint values, it efficiently approximates the integer square root while maintaining strict bounds on the result.

The key insight involves maintaining two critical invariants: ensuring the lower bound is always less than or equal to the upper bound, and guaranteeing that the computed value satisfies specific square constraints relative to the input number.

--- RESPONSE ---
<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python code:

1. The function takes two intervals (tuples of integers representing start and end points)
2. It finds the intersection of these intervals by taking max of starts and min of ends
3. It calculates the length of the intersection (end - start + 1, since intervals are closed)
4. It checks if the length is a prime number using a helper function
5. Returns "YES" if the length is prime, "NO" otherwise (including when no intersection exists)

For the Dafny translation:
- Input: I can represent intervals as separate integer parameters (start1, end1, start2, end2) 
- Output: string ("YES" or "NO")
- I need to implement the is_prime helper function
- Pre-conditions: start1 <= end1 and start2 <= end2 (from documentation)
- Post-conditions: result is either "YES" or "NO"

For the is_prime function, I need to handle the primality test with proper termination. The Python code checks divisors from 3 to sqrt(n). I'll implement this with a recursive helper function.

  requires n >= 0
{
  if n < 2 then false
  else if n == 2 then true

}

function is_prime_helper(n: int, i: int): bool
  requires n >= 3
  requires i >= 3 && i % 2 == 1
  decreases if i * i <= n then n - i else 0
{
  if i * i > n then true
  else if n % i == 0 then false
  else is_prime_helper(n, i + 2)
}

method intersection(start1: int, end1: int, start2: int, end2: int) returns (result: string)
  requires start1 <= end1
  requires start2 <= end2
  ensures result == "YES" || result == "NO"
{
  // Find the intersection bounds
  var intersection_start := if start1 > start2 then start1 else start2;
  var intersection_end := if end1 < end2 then end1 else end2;
  
  // Check if there's actually an intersection
  if intersection_start > intersection_end {
    result := "NO";
  } else {
    // Calculate the length of the intersection
    // Since intervals are closed, length = end - start + 1
    var intersection_length := intersection_end - intersection_start + 1;
    
    // Check if the length is prime
    if is_prime(intersection_length) {
      result := "YES";
    } else {
      result := "NO";
    }
  }
