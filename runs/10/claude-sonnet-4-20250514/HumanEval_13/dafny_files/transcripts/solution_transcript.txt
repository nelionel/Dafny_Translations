=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python


def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """ Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
    1
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
    5
    """

def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """ Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
    1
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
    5
    """
    # Handle the case where one or both numbers are zero
    a, b = abs(a), abs(b)
    
    # Euclid's algorithm
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    
    return a
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `greatest_common_divisor`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. The function `greatest_common_divisor` takes two integers `a` and `b` and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD).

2. The function first takes the absolute values of both inputs to handle negative numbers.

3. It uses Euclid's algorithm: while `b != 0`, we set `a, b = b, a % b`, and then return `a`.

For the Dafny translation:

**Types**: 
- Python `int` maps to Dafny `int`
- The function returns an `int`

**Pre-conditions**: 
- We need to handle the case where both inputs are 0. The GCD of 0 and 0 is undefined mathematically, but commonly we might say it's 0. However, let me check what the Python function would do:
  - If a=0 and b=0, after taking abs, we have a=0, b=0
  - The while loop condition `b != 0` is false, so we skip the loop
  - We return a, which is 0
- So it seems like GCD(0,0) = 0 in this implementation
- Actually, let's be more careful. We should probably require that at least one of the inputs is non-zero, but the Python code handles the case where both are zero by returning 0.

**Post-conditions**:
- The result should be the GCD of the absolute values of the inputs
- The result should be non-negative (since we take absolute values)
- The result should divide both |a| and |b|
- For any common divisor d of |a| and |b|, d should divide the result

**Loop invariants**:
- In the while loop, we need to maintain that gcd(a, b) at each step equals gcd(original_a, original_b)
- Also, a >= 0 and b >= 0


- The loop's termination relies on `b` consistently decreasing
- We'll use `b` as the termination metric to ensure the algorithm converges
- Each iteration reduces the problem to a smaller subproblem by taking the remainder

The algorithm guarantees termination through its systematic reduction of input values, ensuring we'll eventually reach the greatest common divisor.

I'll implement the Euclidean algorithm with careful invariants to prove correctness. The method will handle absolute values and systematically compute the GCD through repeated modulo operations.

The key is maintaining the mathematical relationship between inputs while progressively simplifying the computation, ultimately converging to the greatest common divisor.

I'll ensure the method handles edge cases like zero inputs and negative numbers, with postconditions that validate the result's mathematical properties. The algorithm reduces the problem by repeatedly replacing the larger number with its remainder until zero is reached.

The implementation uses a while loop with decreasing complexity, guaranteeing termination and preserving the core GCD relationship throughout the computation.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Function purpose**: Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using Euclid's algorithm.

2. **Types**: Python `int` maps to Dafny `int`. The function returns an `int`.

3. **Logic analysis**:
   - Takes absolute values of both inputs to handle negative numbers
   - Uses Euclid's algorithm: while `b != 0`, set `a, b = b, a % b`
   - Returns `a` when the loop terminates

4. **Pre-conditions**: None explicitly needed - the function handles all integer inputs including zero.

5. **Post-conditions**: 
   - Result should be non-negative (since we use absolute values)
   - Result should be the GCD of |a| and |b|
   - When both inputs are 0, result should be 0

6. **Loop invariants**:
   - Both variables remain non-negative
   - The GCD of the current values equals the GCD of the original absolute values

7. **Termination**: The second variable `y` decreases in each iteration (since `x % y < y` when `y > 0`), so we can use `decreases y`.

I need to implement this without using axioms. Since I can't define a separate `gcd` function easily, I'll focus on the key mathematical properties that the result should satisfy.
