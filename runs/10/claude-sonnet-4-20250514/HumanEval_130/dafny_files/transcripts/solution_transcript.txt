You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def tri(n):
    """Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
    the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Examples:
    tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `tri`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python code carefully:

1. The function `tri(n)` returns a list of the first n+1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.

2. The Tribonacci sequence is defined as:
   - tri(0) = 1 (implied from the example)
   - tri(1) = 3
   - For even n >= 2: tri(n) = 1 + n / 2
   - For odd n >= 3: tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1)

3. The algorithm:
   - If n == 0, return [1]
   - Initialize result array of size n+1
   - Set result[0] = 1, result[1] = 3 (if n >= 1)
   - Fill even positions first: result[i] = 1 + i // 2 for even i >= 2
   - Fill odd positions: result[i] = result[i-1] + result[i-2] + result[i+1] for odd i >= 3

For Dafny translation:
- The return type should be `seq<int>` since we're dealing with integers
- We need to handle the division carefully - in Python `i // 2` is integer division
- The precondition is `n >= 0`
- The postcondition should ensure the result has length n+1
- We need loop invariants for the two loops
- Termination is straightforward since both loops have finite bounds

Let me write the Dafny code:

```dafny
method tri(n: int) returns (result: seq<int>)
  requires n >= 0
  ensures |result| == n + 1
{
  if n == 0 {
    return [1];
  }
  
  // Initialize the result array
  var arr := new int[n + 1];
  
  // Set initial values for base cases
  arr[0] := 1;  // First element is always 1
  if n >= 1 {
    arr[1] := 3;  // Second element is 3 when n >= 1
  }
  
  // Populate even indices systematically
  var i := 2;
  while i <= n
    invariant 2 <= i <= n + 1
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i && j % 2 == 0 ==> arr[j] == if j == 0 then 1 else 1 + j / 2
  {
    arr[i] := 1 + i / 2;
    i := i + 1;
  }
  
  // Process odd positions using dependencies
  i := 3;
  while i <= n
    invariant 3 <= i <= n + 1
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i && j % 2 == 1 ==> j == 1 || arr[j] == arr[j-1] + arr[j-2] + arr[j+1]
  {
    arr[i] := arr[i - 1] + arr[i - 2] + arr[i + 1];
    i := i + 1;
  }
  
  // Finalize sequence conversion
  result := arr[..];

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python code:

1. The function `tri(n)` returns a list of the first n+1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
2. The sequence is defined with:
   - tri(0) = 1 (implied from example)
   - tri(1) = 3
   - For even n >= 2: tri(n) = 1 + n / 2
   - For odd n >= 3: tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1)

3. The algorithm first calculates all even positions (which don't depend on odd positions), then calculates odd positions (which depend on neighboring values).

For Dafny:
- Return type: `seq<int>` 
- Precondition: `n >= 0`
- Postcondition: result has length n+1
- Need loop invariants for both loops
- Division in Python `i // 2` maps to `i / 2` in Dafny (integer division)
