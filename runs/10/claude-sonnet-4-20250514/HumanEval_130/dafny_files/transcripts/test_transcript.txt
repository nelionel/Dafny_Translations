=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `tri`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python
def check(candidate):

    # Check some simple cases
    
    assert candidate(3) == [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0]
    assert candidate(4) == [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0, 3.0]
    assert candidate(5) == [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0, 3.0, 15.0]
    assert candidate(6) == [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0, 3.0, 15.0, 4.0]
    assert candidate(7) == [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0, 3.0, 15.0, 4.0, 24.0]
    assert candidate(8) == [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0, 3.0, 15.0, 4.0, 24.0, 5.0]
    assert candidate(9) == [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0, 3.0, 15.0, 4.0, 24.0, 5.0, 35.0]
    assert candidate(20) == [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0, 3.0, 15.0, 4.0, 24.0, 5.0, 35.0, 6.0, 48.0, 7.0, 63.0, 8.0, 80.0, 9.0, 99.0, 10.0, 120.0, 11.0]

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert candidate(0) == [1]
    assert candidate(1) == [1, 3]

```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method tri(n: int) returns (result: seq<int>)
  requires n >= 0
  ensures |result| == n + 1
{
  if n == 0 {
    return [1];
  }
  
  // Initialize the result array
  var arr := new int[n + 1];
  
  // Base cases
  arr[0] := 1;  // tri(0) = 1
  if n >= 1 {
    arr[1] := 3;  // tri(1) = 3
  }
  
  // Calculate even positions first (they don't depend on odd positions)
  var i := 2;
  while i <= n
    invariant 2 <= i <= n + 1
    invariant arr[0] == 1
    invariant n >= 1 ==> arr[1] == 3
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i && j % 2 == 0 && j >= 2 ==> arr[j] == 1 + j / 2
  {
    if i % 2 == 0 {
      arr[i] := 1 + i / 2;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  
  // Calculate odd positions (they depend on even positions and previous odd positions)
  i := 3;
  while i <= n
    invariant 3 <= i <= n + 1
    invariant arr[0] == 1
    invariant n >= 1 ==> arr[1] == 3
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j <= n && j % 2 == 0 && j >= 2 ==> arr[j] == 1 + j / 2
    invariant forall j :: 1 <= j < i && j % 2 == 1 && j >= 3 ==> arr[j] == arr[j-1] + arr[j-2] + arr[j+1]
  {
    if i % 2 == 1 {
      arr[i] := arr[i - 1] + arr[i - 2] + arr[i + 1];
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  
  // Convert array to sequence
  result := arr[..];
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`tri`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `tri` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `tri` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python tests and the Dafny solution:

1. The method to test is named `tri` and has signature `method tri(n: int) returns (result: seq<int>)`
2. Looking at the Python tests, they expect the function to return arrays/lists with float values, but the Dafny solution returns `seq<int>`. Let me check...

Looking at the tests more carefully:
- `candidate(3) == [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0]` - this has float values
- `candidate(4) == [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0, 3.0]` - also has float values

But the Dafny solution returns `seq<int>`. This seems like a mismatch. Let me look at the solution again...

Actually, looking at the Dafny code, it returns `seq<int>`, but the Python tests expect float values. This might be because the original problem involved floating point numbers, but the Dafny implementation uses integers.

Let me assume that the Dafny implementation should actually return a sequence that can contain both integers and floats. But since Dafny is strongly typed, I think the implementation might need to be `seq<real>` instead of `seq<int>`.

But wait, let me stick to what's given. The Dafny solution says `seq<int>`, so I'll create tests that expect integer sequences, but I'll need to convert the expected float values to integers where appropriate.

Actually, looking more closely at the test values:
- 2.0 should be 2
- 8.0 should be 8  
- 3.0 should be 3
- etc.

So I think the Python tests are using floats but they're all whole numbers, so I can convert them to integers for the Dafny tests.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the Dafny solution, I can see the `tri` method has signature `method tri(n: int) returns (result: seq<int>)` and returns a sequence of integers.

<dummy>
method tri(n: int) returns (result: seq<int>)
  requires n >= 0
  ensures |result| == n + 1
{
    result := [0];
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := tri(3);
    expect result == [1, 3, 2, 8];
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := tri(4);
    expect result == [1, 3, 2, 8, 3];
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := tri(5);
    expect result == [1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 15];
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := tri(6);
    expect result == [1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 15, 4];
}

method {:test} test_4()
{
    var result := tri(7);
    expect result == [1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 15, 4, 24];
}

method {:test} test_5()
{
    var result := tri(8);
    expect result == [1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 15, 4, 24, 5];
}

method {:test} test_6()
{
    var result := tri(9);
    expect result == [1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 15, 4, 24, 5, 35];
}

method {:test} test_7()
{
    var result := tri(20);
    expect result == [1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 15, 4, 24, 5, 35, 6, 48, 7, 63, 8, 80, 9, 99, 10, 120, 11];
}

method {:test} test_8()
{
    var result := tri(0);
    expect result == [1];
}

method {:test} test_9()
{
    var result := tri(1);
    expect result == [1, 3];
}
```
