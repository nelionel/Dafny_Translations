def tri(n):

    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:

    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)

======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to implement the Tribonacci sequence with the given recurrence relations:

- tri(1) = 3
- tri(n) = 1 + n/2, if n is even
- tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1), if n is odd

The tricky part is that for odd n, we need tri(n+1) to calculate tri(n), which creates a dependency issue. I'll need to use dynamic programming and calculate values in a way that resolves these dependencies.

```python
def tri(n):
    """Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
    the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Examples:
    tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]
    """
    if n == 0:
        return [1]
    
    # Initialize the result list
    result = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Base cases
    result[0] = 1  # tri(0) = 1 (implied from the example)
    if n >= 1:
        result[1] = 3  # tri(1) = 3
    
    # Calculate even positions first (they don't depend on odd positions)
    for i in range(2, n + 1, 2):  # Even positions
        result[i] = 1 + i // 2
    
    # Calculate odd positions (they depend on even positions and previous odd positions)
    for i in range(3, n + 1, 2):  # Odd positions starting from 3
        result[i] = result[i - 1] + result[i - 2] + result[i + 1]
    
    return result
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this approach. The issue is that for odd positions, we need the value at position i+1, but if i+1 is even, we can calculate it directly. However, if we're calculating positions sequentially, we might not have calculated i+1 yet.

Let me revise:

```python
def tri(n):
    """Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
    the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Examples:
    tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]
    """
    if n == 0:
        return [1]
    
    # Initialize the result list
    result = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Base cases
    result[0] = 1  # tri(0) = 1 (implied from the example)
    if n >= 1:
        result[1] = 3  # tri(1) = 3
    
    # Helper function to get tri(i) value
    def get_tri_value(i):
        if i > n:
            # For values beyond n, we calculate them using the recurrence
            if i % 2 == 0:  # even
                return 1 + i // 2
            else:  # odd - this shouldn't happen in our case since we only need i+1 where i is odd
                return 0
        return result[i]
    
    # Calculate values for positions 2 to n
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:  # even
            result[i] = 1 + i // 2
        else:  # odd
            # For odd positions, we need tri(i+1)
            if i + 1 <= n:
                next_val = get_tri_value(i + 1) if result[i + 1] != 0 else (1 + (i + 1) // 2)
            else:
                next_val = 1 + (i + 1) // 2  # i+1 is even
            
            result[i] = result[i - 1] + result[i - 2] + next_val
    
    return result
```

Actually, let me simplify this. Since we know that for any even number k, tri(k) = 1 + k/2, we can calculate this on the fly:

```python
def tri(n):
    """Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
    the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.

    result = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Base cases
    result[0] = 1  # tri(0) = 1 (from example)
    if n >= 1:
        result[1] = 3  # tri(1) = 3
    
    # Calculate values for positions 2 to n
