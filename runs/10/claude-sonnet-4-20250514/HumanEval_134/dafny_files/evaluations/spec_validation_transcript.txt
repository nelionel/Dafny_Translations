You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    '''
    Create a function that returns True if the last character
    of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not
    a part of a word, and False otherwise.
    Note: "word" is a group of characters separated by space.

    Examples:
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e") ➞ True
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("") ➞ False 
    '''
    # Check if string is empty
    if not txt:
        return False
    
    # Check if last character is alphabetical
    if not txt[-1].isalpha():
        return False
    
    # If string has only one character, it's not part of a word
    if len(txt) == 1:
        return True
    
    # Check if the character before the last one is a space
    # This ensures the last character is not part of a word
    return txt[-2] == ' '
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
predicate IsAlpha(c: char)
{
    ('a' <= c <= 'z') || ('A' <= c <= 'Z')
}

method check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt: string) returns (result: bool)
    ensures result == (|txt| > 0 && IsAlpha(txt[|txt|-1]) && (|txt| == 1 || txt[|txt|-2] == ' '))
{
    if |txt| == 0 {
        return false;
    }
    
    if !IsAlpha(txt[|txt|-1]) {
        return false;
    }
    
    if |txt| == 1 {
        return true;
    }
    
    return txt[|txt|-2] == ' ';
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function and the Dafny code:

**Python function behavior:**
1. If string is empty, return False
2. If last character is NOT alphabetical, return False
3. If string has only one character AND it's alphabetical, return True
4. If string has more than one character AND last character is alphabetical AND the character before it is a space, return True
5. Otherwise, return False

**Dafny code:**
The predicate `IsAlpha` checks if a character is a letter (a-z or A-Z).

The method:
1. If string is empty (|txt| == 0), return false
2. If last character is not alphabetical, return false
3. If string has one character, return true
4. Otherwise, return whether the second-to-last character is a space

The ensures clause: `ensures result == (|txt| > 0 && IsAlpha(txt[|txt|-1]) && (|txt| == 1 || txt[|txt|-2] == ' '))`

Let me break this down:
- `|txt| > 0`: string is not empty
- `IsAlpha(txt[|txt|-1])`: last character is alphabetical
- `(|txt| == 1 || txt[|txt|-2] == ' ')`: either the string has one character OR the second-to-last character is a space

This looks correct. Let me trace through the examples:

1. "apple pie" - last char is 'e', which is alpha, but txt[|txt|-2] = 'i' != ' ', so result should be false. The ensures clause would give: true && true && false = false. ✓

2. "apple pi e" - last char is 'e', which is alpha, and txt[|txt|-2] = ' ', so result should be true. The ensures clause would give: true && true && true = true. ✓
 
I'll verify the additional test cases. The string "apple pi e " fails because the last character is a space, which is not alphabetical. This means the method returns false, consistent with the specification. An empty string also correctly returns false, as it doesn't meet the initial condition of having a non-zero length.

The implementation carefully checks three key conditions: non-empty string, alphabetical last character, and either single-character or space before the last character. This ensures precise validation of the string's ending.

--- RESPONSE ---
THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS

```dafny
predicate IsAlpha(c: char)
{
    ('a' <= c <= 'z') || ('A' <= c <= 'Z')
}

method check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt: string) returns (result: bool)
    ensures result == (|txt| > 0 && IsAlpha(txt[|txt|-1]) && (|txt| == 1 || txt[|txt|-2] == ' '))
{
    if |txt| == 0 {
        return false;
    }
    
    if !IsAlpha(txt[|txt|-1]) {
        return false;
    }
    
    if |txt| == 1 {
        return true;
    }
    
    return txt[|txt|-2] == ' ';
}
```
