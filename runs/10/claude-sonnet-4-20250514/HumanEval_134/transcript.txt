======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

======USER PROMPT======

def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    '''
    Create a function that returns True if the last character
    of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not
    a part of a word, and False otherwise.
    Note: "word" is a group of characters separated by space.

    Examples:
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e") ➞ True
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("") ➞ False 
    '''


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to check if:
1. The last character is alphabetical
2. The last character is not part of a word (i.e., it's a single character separated by spaces)

Let me analyze the examples:
- "apple pie" → False (last char 'e' is part of word "pie")
- "apple pi e" → True (last char 'e' is alphabetical and separated by space)
- "apple pi e " → False (last char is a space, not alphabetical)
- "" → False (empty string)

```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    '''
    Create a function that returns True if the last character
    of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not
    a part of a word, and False otherwise.
    Note: "word" is a group of characters separated by space.

    Examples:
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e") ➞ True
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("") ➞ False 
    '''
    # Check if string is empty
    if not txt:
        return False
    
    # Check if last character is alphabetical
    if not txt[-1].isalpha():
        return False
    
    # If string has only one character, it's not part of a word
    if len(txt) == 1:
        return True
    
    # Check if the character before the last one is a space
    # This ensures the last character is not part of a word
    return txt[-2] == ' '
```
