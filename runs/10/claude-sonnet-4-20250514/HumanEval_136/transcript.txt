======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

======USER PROMPT======

def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    '''
    Create a function that returns a tuple (a, b), where 'a' is
    the largest of negative integers, and 'b' is the smallest
    of positive integers in a list.
    If there is no negative or positive integers, return them as None.

    Examples:
    largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]) == (None, 1)
    largest_smallest_integers([]) == (None, None)
    largest_smallest_integers([0]) == (None, None)
    '''


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Find the largest negative integer in the list (closest to 0)
2. Find the smallest positive integer in the list (closest to 0)
3. Return None for either if they don't exist
4. Note that 0 is neither positive nor negative

Here's my implementation:

```python
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    '''
    Create a function that returns a tuple (a, b), where 'a' is
    the largest of negative integers, and 'b' is the smallest
    of positive integers in a list.
    If there is no negative or positive integers, return them as None.

    Examples:
    largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]) == (None, 1)
    largest_smallest_integers([]) == (None, None)
    largest_smallest_integers([0]) == (None, None)
    '''
    
    # Filter negative and positive integers
    negative_integers = [x for x in lst if x < 0]
    positive_integers = [x for x in lst if x > 0]
    
    # Find largest negative (closest to 0) or None if no negatives
    largest_negative = max(negative_integers) if negative_integers else None
    
    # Find smallest positive (closest to 0) or None if no positives
    smallest_positive = min(positive_integers) if positive_integers else None
    
    return (largest_negative, smallest_positive)
```

The function works by:
1. Creating two separate lists: one for negative integers and one for positive integers
2. Using `max()` on the negative integers to find the largest (closest to 0)
3. Using `min()` on the positive integers to find the smallest (closest to 0)
4. Returning `None` for either category if no integers exist in that category
5. Zero is excluded since it's neither positive nor negative
