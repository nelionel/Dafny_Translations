=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers
    Example
    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True
    """

def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers
    Example
    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True
    """
    # A number can be written as sum of 4 positive even numbers if:
    # 1. It's even (sum of even numbers is always even)
    # 2. It's at least 8 (minimum sum: 2+2+2+2 = 8)
    return n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `is_equal_to_sum_even`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze this Python function:

1. The function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` takes an integer `n` and returns a boolean
2. It checks if `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers
3. The logic is:
   - A number can be written as sum of 4 positive even numbers if:
   - It's even (sum of even numbers is always even)
   - It's at least 8 (minimum sum: 2+2+2+2 = 8)
4. So it returns `n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8`

For the Dafny translation:
- Input type: `int` (for the integer n)
- Return type: `bool` 
- No loops or recursion, so no need for invariants or decreases clauses
- Pre-conditions: None really needed, the function can handle any integer
- Post-conditions: I should specify what the function returns - it returns true iff n is even and >= 8

Let me think about the mathematical reasoning:
- For a number to be expressible as sum of 4 positive even numbers, we need a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 = n where each ai is a positive even number
- The smallest positive even number is 2
- So the minimum possible sum is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8
- Any sum of even numbers is even
- Conversely, if n is even and n >= 8, can we always express it as sum of 4 positive even numbers?
  - If n >= 8 and n is even, we can write n = 8 + (n-8) = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + (n-8)
  - Since n is even and 8 is even, (n-8) is even


- We can distribute the extra amount among four 2's
- By breaking down n into (2 + k) + 2 + 2 + 2, where k = n-8 and k is non-negative and even
- This proves any even number >= 8 can be decomposed into four positive even numbers

The mathematical proof confirms the function's core logic: an integer is representable as a sum of 4 positive even numbers if and only if it's even and at least 8.

<thinking>
Let me analyze this Python function:

1. **Function analysis**: The function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` takes an integer `n` and returns a boolean indicating whether `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.

2. **Logic**: The function returns `True` if and only if:
   - `n` is even (since sum of even numbers is always even)
   - `n >= 8` (since the minimum sum is 2+2+2+2 = 8)

3. **Types**: 
   - Input: `int` in Dafny
   - Output: `bool` in Dafny

4. **Pre/post-conditions**:
   - No preconditions needed (function works for any integer)
   - Post-condition: the result is true iff `n` is even and `n >= 8`

5. **No loops or recursion**: This is a simple arithmetic check, so no invariants or decreases clauses needed.

The mathematical reasoning is sound: a number can be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers if and only if it's even and at least 8.

```dafny
method is_equal_to_sum_even(n: int) returns (result: bool)
    ensures result == (n % 2 == 0 && n >= 8)
{
    result := n % 2 == 0 && n >= 8;
}
```
