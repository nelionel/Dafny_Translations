def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers
    Example

    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to determine if a number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.

Let me think about this:
- Positive even numbers are: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...
- The smallest possible sum of 4 positive even numbers would be: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8
- Any sum of 4 even numbers will always be even (since even + even = even)

So for a number to be expressible as the sum of 4 positive even numbers:
1. It must be even
2. It must be at least 8

Let me verify with the examples:
- `is_equal_to_sum_even(4)` should return `False` because 4 < 8
- `is_equal_to_sum_even(6)` should return `False` because 6 < 8  
- `is_equal_to_sum_even(8)` should return `True` because 8 = 2+2+2+2

For any even number â‰¥ 8, we can always find a combination. For example:
- 8 = 2+2+2+2
- 10 = 2+2+2+4
- 12 = 2+2+2+6 or 2+2+4+4
- And so on...

```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers
    Example
    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True
    """
    # A number can be written as sum of 4 positive even numbers if:
    # 1. It's even (sum of even numbers is always even)
    # 2. It's at least 8 (minimum sum: 2+2+2+2 = 8)
    return n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8
