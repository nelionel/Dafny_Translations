    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to implement a function that calculates the "Brazilian factorial" which is the product of all factorials from 1! to n!.

Let me break this down:
- For n=4: 4! × 3! × 2! × 1! = 24 × 6 × 2 × 1 = 288
- I need to calculate each factorial and multiply them together

Here's my implementation:

```python
def special_factorial(n):
    """The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
    where n > 0

    For example:
    >>> special_factorial(4)
    288

    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
    factorial of this integer.
    """
    def factorial(num):
        """Helper function to calculate factorial of a number"""
        if num <= 1:
            return 1
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, num + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
    
    if n <= 0:
        return 1
    
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= factorial(i)
    
    return result
```

The solution works as follows:

1. I define a helper function `factorial(num)` that calculates the standard factorial of a number
2. For the special factorial, I iterate from 1 to n (inclusive)
3. For each number i, I calculate i! using the helper function and multiply it to the result
4. I handle the edge case where n <= 0 by returning 1

Let me verify with the example:
- special_factorial(4) = 1! × 2! × 3! × 4! = 1 × 2 × 6 × 24 = 288 ✓
