=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
from typing import List


def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """
    return [string[:i] for i in range(1, len(string) + 1)]
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
method all_prefixes(s: string) returns (result: seq<string>)
    ensures |result| == |s|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == s[0..i+1]
{
    result := [];
    var i := 1;
    while i <= |s|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |s| + 1
        invariant |result| == i - 1
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < |result| ==> result[j] == s[0..j+1]
        decreases |s| - i + 1
    {
        result := result + [s[0..i]];
        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function behavior and the Dafny specifications:

**Python Function Behavior:**
```python
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string[:i] for i in range(1, len(string) + 1)]
```

This function:
1. Takes a string as input
2. Returns a list of all prefixes from shortest to longest
3. For a string of length n, it returns n prefixes: string[:1], string[:2], ..., string[:n]
4. If the input string is empty, it returns an empty list (since range(1, 0+1) = range(1, 1) is empty)

**Dafny Specifications Analysis:**

1. `ensures |result| == |s|` - This says the result has the same length as the input string. This is correct for non-empty strings, but what about empty strings?

For an empty string (length 0), the Python function returns [] (empty list), so |result| = 0 and |s| = 0, so this is correct.

2. `ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == s[0..i+1]` - This says that the i-th element of the result is s[0..i+1].

Let's check:
- result[0] should be s[0..1] (first character)
- result[1] should be s[0..2] (first two characters)
- result[i] should be s[0..i+1] (first i+1 characters)

This looks correct.

Wait, let me double-check the Python behavior:
- `string[:i] for i in range(1, len(string) + 1)`
- For string "abc" (length 3), range(1, 4) gives [1, 2, 3]
- So we get ["abc"[:1], "abc"[:2], "abc"[:3]] = ["a", "ab", "abc"]


- result[0] = "a" = s[0..1] ✓
- result[1] = "ab" = s[0..2] ✓
- result[2] = "abc" = s[0..3] ✓

For empty string:
- range(1, 0+1) = range(1, 1) = [] (empty)
- So result = [] (empty list)
- |result| = 0 = |s| ✓
- The forall condition is vacuously true since there are no elements

I'll verify the edge cases and potential requirements. The specifications appear robust, covering both non-empty and empty string scenarios. The implementation ensures consistent prefix generation across different input types.

Key observations:
- No explicit preconditions limit the function's flexibility
- Handles empty, single-character, and longer strings uniformly
- Loop logic generates prefixes systematically
- Result length always matches input string length

The implementation precisely follows the specified behavior, creating a comprehensive prefix list for any given input string.

--- RESPONSE ---
THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS

```dafny
method all_prefixes(s: string) returns (result: seq<string>)
    ensures |result| == |s|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == s[0..i+1]
{
    result := [];
    var i := 1;
    while i <= |s|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |s| + 1
        invariant |result| == i - 1
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < |result| ==> result[j] == s[0..j+1]
        decreases |s| - i + 1
    {
        result := result + [s[0..i]];
        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```
