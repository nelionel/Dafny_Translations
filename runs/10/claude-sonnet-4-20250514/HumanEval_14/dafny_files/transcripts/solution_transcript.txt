=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python
from typing import List


def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """

from typing import List


def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """
    return [string[:i] for i in range(1, len(string) + 1)]
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `all_prefixes`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Looking at this Python function:

```python
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """
    return [string[:i] for i in range(1, len(string) + 1)]
```

The function takes a string and returns a list of all prefixes from shortest to longest.

For the example `all_prefixes('abc')`:
- `i = 1`: `string[:1]` = `'a'`
- `i = 2`: `string[:2]` = `'ab'`
- `i = 3`: `string[:3]` = `'abc'`

So it returns `['a', 'ab', 'abc']`.

Now, to translate this to Dafny:

1. **Types**: 
   - Python `str` maps to Dafny `string`
   - Python `List[str]` maps to Dafny `seq<string>`

2. **Logic**: 
   - The function generates all prefixes from length 1 to the full length of the string
   - Pre-conditions: None really needed, works for any string
   - Post-conditions: 
     - The result should have the same length as the input string
     - Each element in the result should be a prefix of the original string
     - The prefixes should be in order from shortest to longest

3. **Implementation**: 
   - I need to use a loop instead of list comprehension
   - I'll build up the sequence incrementally

4. **Loop invariants**:
   - The result so far contains all prefixes of lengths 1 to i-1
   - Each element is a valid prefix
   - The length of the result is i-1

5. **Termination**: The loop variable i increases from 1 to len(string)+1, so it terminates when i > len(string).


I'll implement the Dafny method to generate prefixes using an iterative approach. The method will build a sequence of prefixes incrementally, ensuring each prefix is correctly extracted from the original string. The implementation follows a careful loop strategy, maintaining key invariants about the result sequence's length and content.

The approach involves starting with an empty sequence and progressively adding prefixes of increasing length. Each iteration will extend the result with a new prefix, carefully tracking the loop conditions to ensure correctness and termination.

By systematically constructing prefixes from the input string, the method guarantees that the final sequence contains all prefixes from length 1 to the full string length. The verification conditions ensure the result matches the expected properties.

Analyzing the progression reveals a precise mechanism: starting at index 1, each iteration captures progressively longer substrings, incrementing the result array while maintaining strict invariants about length and content. The decreasing clause ensures termination by tracking remaining string segments.

The key observation is the methodical construction of prefixes, where each step builds upon the previous substring, creating a comprehensive collection of increasingly longer substrings from the original input.

Looking at this Python function:

```python
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string[:i] for i in range(1, len(string) + 1)]
```

The function takes a string and returns a list of all prefixes from shortest to longest.

For the example `all_prefixes('abc')`:
- `i = 1`: `string[:1]` = `'a'`
- `i = 2`: `string[:2]` = `'ab'`  
- `i = 3`: `string[:3]` = `'abc'`

So it returns `['a', 'ab', 'abc']`.

To translate to Dafny:

1. **Types**: 
   - Python `str` → Dafny `string`
   - Python `List[str]` → Dafny `seq<string>`

2. **Logic**: 
   - Generate all prefixes from length 1 to full length of string
   - Pre-conditions: None needed, works for any string
   - Post-conditions: 
     - Result length equals input string length
     - Each element is a proper prefix of the original string
     - Prefixes are ordered from shortest to longest

3. **Implementation**: 
   - Use a while loop instead of list comprehension
   - Build up sequence incrementally using string slicing

4. **Loop invariants**:
   - Result contains all prefixes of lengths 1 to i-1
   - Each element is the correct prefix
   - Result length is i-1

5. **Termination**: Loop variable i increases from 1 to |string|+1, so `decreases |string| - i + 1`

```dafny

    ensures |result| == |string|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == string[0..i+1]

    result := [];
    var i := 1;

        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < |result| ==> result[j] == string[0..j+1]
        decreases |string| - i + 1
    {
        result := result + [string[0..i]];
        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

The error shows that `string` is a reserved keyword in Dafny. I need to use a different variable name. Also, I need to be careful about the syntax.

Let me fix this by using a different parameter name like `s` or `str_input`.

```dafny
method all_prefixes(s: string) returns (result: seq<string>)
    ensures |result| == |s|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == s[0..i+1]

    result := [];
