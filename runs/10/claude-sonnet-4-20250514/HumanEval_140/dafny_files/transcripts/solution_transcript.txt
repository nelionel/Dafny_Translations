You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def fix_spaces(text):
    """
    Given a string text, replace all spaces in it with underscores, 
    and if a string has more than 2 consecutive spaces, 
    then replace all consecutive spaces with - 
    
    fix_spaces("Example") == "Example"
    fix_spaces("Example 1") == "Example_1"
    fix_spaces(" Example 2") == "_Example_2"
    fix_spaces(" Example   3") == "_Example-3"
    """

def fix_spaces(text):
    """
    Given a string text, replace all spaces in it with underscores, 
    and if a string has more than 2 consecutive spaces, 
    then replace all consecutive spaces with -

    """
    if not text:
        return text
    
    result = []
    i = 0
    
    while i < len(text):
        if text[i] == ' ':
            # Count consecutive spaces
            space_count = 0
            j = i
            while j < len(text) and text[j] == ' ':
                space_count += 1
                j += 1
            
            # Replace based on count
            if space_count > 2:
                result.append('-')
            else:
                result.append('_' * space_count)
            
            i = j
        else:
            result.append(text[i])
            i += 1
    
    return ''.join(result)
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `fix_spaces`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. The function takes a string `text` as input.
2. It iterates through the string and processes spaces:
   - If there are 1-2 consecutive spaces, replace them with underscores (one underscore per space)
   - If there are more than 2 consecutive spaces, replace all consecutive spaces with a single dash '-'
   - Non-space characters are kept as-is

The logic:
- Handle empty string case
- Use a result list to build the output
- Iterate through characters:
  - If current character is a space, count consecutive spaces
  - Based on count, append either underscores or a single dash
  - If not a space, append the character as-is
- Join the result and return

For Dafny:
- Input type: `string` 
- Return type: `string`
- Need to handle string indexing and character operations
- Need loop invariants for the main loop
- Need termination proof (decreases clause)

Let me think about the specifications:
- Preconditions: None really needed, works for any string
- Postconditions: The result should have the correct length relationship and transformations

For the loop:
- We need to track position `i` in the input string
- We need to build a result string
- Loop invariant: `i` is within bounds, result contains processed characters up to position `i`
- Termination: `decreases |text| - i`

Let me write the Dafny code:

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Function analysis**: The function takes a string and processes spaces:
   - 1-2 consecutive spaces → replace with underscores (1 underscore per space)
   - More than 2 consecutive spaces → replace with a single dash '-'
   - Non-space characters remain unchanged

2. **Type mapping**: 
   - Python `str` → Dafny `string`
   - Return type is `string`

3. **Algorithm logic**:
   - Handle empty string case
   - Iterate through characters with index `i`
   - When encountering spaces, count consecutive spaces starting from `i`
   - Replace based on count, then advance `i` past all processed spaces
   - For non-spaces, just append and increment `i`

4. **Specifications**:
   - No meaningful preconditions needed
   - Postcondition could verify the transformation rules
   - Loop invariant: `i` is within valid range, result built correctly up to `i`
   - Termination: `decreases |text| - i` since `i` always increases

5. **Implementation details**:
   - Need helper to count consecutive spaces
   - Build result string incrementally
   - Handle string concatenation in Dafny
