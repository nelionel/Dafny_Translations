You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def file_name_check(file_name):
    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `file_name_check`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. The function takes a string `file_name` and returns 'Yes' or 'No' (strings).
2. It checks several conditions:
   - Exactly one dot '.'
   - The part before the dot is not empty and starts with a letter
   - The part after the dot is one of 'txt', 'exe', 'dll'
   - No more than 3 digits in the entire filename

Let me trace through the algorithm:
1. Check if there's exactly one dot by counting dots
2. Split by dot to get name and extension parts
3. Check if name part is not empty
4. Check if name part starts with a letter (alphabetic character)
5. Check if extension is in the valid list
6. Count digits in the entire filename and check if <= 3

For Dafny:
- Input: `string` (file_name)
- Output: `string` (either "Yes" or "No")
- I need helper functions to:
  - Count occurrences of a character in a string
  - Split a string by a delimiter
  - Check if a character is alphabetic
  - Check if a character is a digit
  - Check if a string is in a set of valid extensions

Let me think about the helper functions I'll need:

1. `CountChar(s: string, c: char) : int` - count occurrences of character c in string s
2. `SplitByDot(s: string) : (string, string)` - split string by first dot (assuming exactly one dot exists)
3. `IsAlpha(c: char) : bool` - check if character is alphabetic
4. `IsDigit(c: char) : bool` - check if character is a digit
5. `CountDigits(s: string) : int` - count digits in string
6. `IsValidExtension(ext: string) : bool` - check if extension is valid


I'll start implementing the Dafny method by first checking the dot count and splitting the filename. The initial steps involve verifying the basic structure of the filename before diving into more specific validations. I'll ensure each condition is carefully checked, returning "No" immediately if any validation fails. The method will methodically break down the filename into its components and apply the specified rules.

The next validation steps involve checking the name part's first character, ensuring it starts with a letter. I'll then verify the file extension's validity and count the number of digits in the entire filename. If any of these checks fail, the method will return "No", otherwise it will return "Yes". This approach provides a comprehensive validation of the filename against the specified criteria.

The helper functions will support these checks by providing utility methods like counting characters, splitting the filename, and performing specific character validations. Each function will be designed to support the main filename validation method efficiently.

I'll need to carefully consider the requires and ensures clauses to ensure robust method contracts and prevent potential runtime errors during filename processing.

The precondition of having exactly one dot provides a strong guarantee for splitting the filename. This allows me to design a more precise method that can confidently separate the filename into its base and extension components without additional complex validation.

By leveraging the existing dot-checking logic, I can create a clean, focused function that assumes the input has been pre-validated, simplifying the implementation and reducing redundant checks.

--- THINKING ---
Looking at the Python function more carefully, I need to translate it to Dafny. Let me analyze:

1. Input: string (file_name)
2. Output: string ("Yes" or "No")
3. Logic:
   - Count dots, must be exactly 1
   - Split by dot to get name and extension parts
   - Name part must not be empty and start with a letter
   - Extension must be one of "txt", "exe", "dll" 
   - Total digits in filename must be <= 3

I need helper functions for:
- Counting characters in a string
- Splitting string by dot  
- Checking if character is alphabetic
- Checking if character is digit
- Counting digits in string
- Checking if extension is valid

Let me implement this step by step:

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Types**: The function takes a `string` and returns a `string` ("Yes" or "No")
2. **Logic**: 
   - Count dots in filename (must be exactly 1)
   - Split by dot to get name and extension parts
   - Check name part is not empty and starts with letter
   - Check extension is one of ["txt", "exe", "dll"]
   - Count digits in entire filename (must be ≤ 3)

3. **Helper functions needed**:
   - Count occurrences of a character in string
   - Split string by dot
   - Check if character is alphabetic/digit
   - Count digits in string
   - Check if extension is valid

4. **Preconditions**: None (function should handle any string input)
5. **Postconditions**: Result is either "Yes" or "No"
6. **Loops**: I'll need loops for counting characters and finding the dot position
7. **Termination**: All loops will be bounded by string length
