You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def sum_squares(lst):
    """"
    This function will take a list of integers. For all entries in the list, the function shall square the integer entry if its index is a 
    multiple of 3 and will cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will not 
    change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries. 
    
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 6
    For lst = []  the output should be 0
    For lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]  the output should be -126
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Square entries at indices that are multiples of 3
2. Cube entries at indices that are multiples of 4 but NOT multiples of 3
3. Leave other entries unchanged
4. Return the sum of all processed entries

Let me trace through the examples to verify my understanding:

For `[1,2,3]`:
- Index 0: multiple of 3 → square 1 = 1
- Index 1: not multiple of 3 or 4 → keep 2
- Index 2: not multiple of 3 or 4 → keep 3
- Sum: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 ✓

For `[-1,-5,2,-1,-5]`:
- Index 0: multiple of 3 → square -1 = 1
- Index 1: not multiple of 3 or 4 → keep -5
- Index 2: not multiple of 3 or 4 → keep 2
- Index 3: not multiple of 3 or 4 → keep -1
- Index 4: multiple of 4 but not 3 → cube -5 = -125
- Sum: 1 + (-5) + 2 + (-1) + (-125) = -128

Wait, the expected output is -126, not -128. Let me reconsider...

Actually, let me check index 4 again: 4 is a multiple of 4, and 4 is not a multiple of 3, so we cube -5 = -125.
Sum: 1 + (-5) + 2 + (-1) + (-125) = -128

There might be an error in the example, but I'll implement according to the specification.

```python
