=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `words_in_sentence`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python
def check(candidate):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert candidate("This is a test") == "is"
    assert candidate("lets go for swimming") == "go for"
    assert candidate("there is no place available here") == "there is no place"
    assert candidate("Hi I am Hussein") == "Hi am Hussein"
    assert candidate("go for it") == "go for it"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert candidate("here") == ""
    assert candidate("here is") == "is"


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method words_in_sentence(sentence: string) returns (result: string)
  requires |sentence| >= 1 && |sentence| <= 100
  ensures |result| <= |sentence|
{
  // Split sentence into words
  var words := split_by_space(sentence);
  
  // Filter words whose lengths are prime
  var prime_words: seq<string> := [];
  var i := 0;
  while i < |words|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |words|
    invariant |prime_words| <= i
    decreases |words| - i
  {
    var word_length := |words[i]|;
    var is_prime_length := is_prime(word_length);
    if is_prime_length {
      prime_words := prime_words + [words[i]];
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  
  // Join filtered words back with spaces
  result := join_with_space(prime_words);
}

method is_prime(n: int) returns (result: bool)
  requires n >= 0
{
  if n < 2 {
    result := false;
  } else if n == 2 {
    result := true;
  } else if n % 2 == 0 {
    result := false;
  } else {
    result := true;
    var i := 3;
    while i * i <= n
      invariant i >= 3
      invariant i % 2 == 1
      invariant result ==> forall k :: 3 <= k < i && k % 2 == 1 ==> n % k != 0
      decreases n - i * i + 1
    {
      if n % i == 0 {
        result := false;
        break;
      }
      i := i + 2;
    }
  }
}

method split_by_space(s: string) returns (words: seq<string>)
  ensures |words| >= 0
{
  words := [];
  if |s| == 0 {
    return;
  }
  
  var current_word := "";
  var i := 0;
  
  while i < |s|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
    decreases |s| - i
  {
    if s[i] == ' ' {
      if |current_word| > 0 {
        words := words + [current_word];
        current_word := "";
      }
    } else {
      current_word := current_word + [s[i]];
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  
  // Add the last word if it's not empty
  if |current_word| > 0 {
    words := words + [current_word];
  }
}

method join_with_space(words: seq<string>) returns (result: string)
{
  result := "";
  var i := 0;
  while i < |words|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |words|
    decreases |words| - i
  {
    if i > 0 {
      result := result + " ";
    }
    result := result + words[i];
    i := i + 1;
  }
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`words_in_sentence`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `words_in_sentence` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `words_in_sentence` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the provided Dafny solution and Python tests:

1. The Dafny method signature is: `method words_in_sentence(sentence: string) returns (result: string)`

2. Looking at the Python tests:
   - `candidate("This is a test") == "is"` - expects "is"
   - `candidate("lets go for swimming") == "go for"` - expects "go for"  
   - `candidate("there is no place available here") == "there is no place"` - expects "there is no place"
   - `candidate("Hi I am Hussein") == "Hi am Hussein"` - expects "Hi am Hussein"
   - `candidate("go for it") == "go for it"` - expects "go for it"
   - `candidate("here") == ""` - expects empty string
   - `candidate("here is") == "is"` - expects "is"

3. For the dummy implementation, I need to create a minimal version that returns a string (default would be empty string "").

4. For the tests, I need to create test methods that call `words_in_sentence` and use `expect` to check the results.

Let me create the dummy implementation and tests now.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the Dafny solution, I can see the method signature is `method words_in_sentence(sentence: string) returns (result: string)` with preconditions and postconditions.

<dummy>
method words_in_sentence(sentence: string) returns (result: string)
  requires |sentence| >= 1 && |sentence| <= 100
  ensures |result| <= |sentence|
{
    result := "";
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := words_in_sentence("This is a test");
    expect result == "is";
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := words_in_sentence("lets go for swimming");
    expect result == "go for";
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := words_in_sentence("there is no place available here");
    expect result == "there is no place";
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := words_in_sentence("Hi I am Hussein");
    expect result == "Hi am Hussein";
}

method {:test} test_4()
{
    var result := words_in_sentence("go for it");
    expect result == "go for it";
}

method {:test} test_5()
{
    var result := words_in_sentence("here");
    expect result == "";
}

method {:test} test_6()
{
    var result := words_in_sentence("here is");
    expect result == "is";
}
```
