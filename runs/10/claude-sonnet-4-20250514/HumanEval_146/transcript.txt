======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def specialFilter(nums):
    """Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns 
    the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both 
    first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
    For example:
    specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]) => 1 
    specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) => 2
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Filter numbers that are greater than 10
2. Check if both the first and last digits are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
3. Count how many numbers meet both criteria

Let me trace through the examples:
- `[15, -73, 14, -15]`: Only 15 > 10, first digit is 1 (odd), last digit is 5 (odd) → count = 1
- `[33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]`: Numbers > 10 are 33, 45, 21, 109
  - 33: first=3(odd), last=3(odd) ✓
  - 45: first=4(even), last=5(odd) ✗
  - 21: first=2(even), last=1(odd) ✗
  - 109: first=1(odd), last=9(odd) ✓
  - count = 2

```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    """Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns 
    the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both 
    first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
    For example:

    """
    count = 0
    odd_digits = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
    
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            # Convert to string to easily access first and last digits
            num_str = str(num)
            first_digit = int(num_str[0])
            last_digit = int(num_str[-1])
            
            # Check if both first and last digits are odd
            if first_digit in odd_digits and last_digit in odd_digits:
                count += 1
    
    return count
