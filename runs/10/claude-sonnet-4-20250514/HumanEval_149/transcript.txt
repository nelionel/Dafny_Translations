======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this function, I need to:

1. Filter out strings with odd lengths
2. Sort the remaining strings first by length, then alphabetically for same-length strings
3. Return the sorted list

Here's the implementation:

```python
def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    """Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,
    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,
    and returns the resulted list with a sorted order,
    The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,
    and it may contain duplicates.
    The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you
    should return the list sorted by that rule.
    If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.
    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.
    You may assume that all words will have the same length.
    For example:
    assert list_sort(["aa", "a", "aaa"]) => ["aa"]
    assert list_sort(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) => ["ab", "cd"]
    """
    # Filter out strings with odd lengths (keep only even-length strings)
    even_length_strings = [s for s in lst if len(s) % 2 == 0]
    
    # Sort by length first, then alphabetically for strings of same length
    sorted_strings = sorted(even_length_strings, key=lambda x: (len(x), x))
    
    return sorted_strings
```

The function works as follows:

1. **Filter odd-length strings**: `[s for s in lst if len(s) % 2 == 0]` keeps only strings with even lengths
2. **Sort with compound key**: `sorted(even_length_strings, key=lambda x: (len(x), x))` sorts first by length (`len(x)`) and then alphabetically (`x`) for strings of the same length
3. **Return the result**: The sorted list of even-length strings

For the examples:
- `["aa", "a", "aaa"]` → filters to `["aa"]` (only "aa" has even length) → returns `["aa"]`
- `["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]` → filters to `["ab", "cd"]` (both have length 2) → sorts alphabetically → returns `["ab", "cd"]`
