=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python


def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    """

def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    """
    return ' '.join(str(i) for i in range(n + 1))
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `string_sequence`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. `string_sequence(n: int) -> str`: Takes an integer `n` and returns a string
2. The function creates a string containing space-delimited numbers from 0 to n inclusive
3. The implementation uses `' '.join(str(i) for i in range(n + 1))`

For the Dafny translation:

**Types:**
- Input: `int` (same as Python)
- Output: `string` (Dafny string type)

**Logic:**
- We need to create a string with numbers from 0 to n, separated by spaces
- For n=0, result is "0"
- For n=5, result is "0 1 2 3 4 5"

**Pre-conditions:**
- We should require n >= 0 since negative numbers don't make sense for this function

**Post-conditions:**
- The result should be a string containing the correct sequence
- The length and format should be correct

**Implementation approach:**
In Dafny, I'll need to:
1. Create a loop from 0 to n
2. Build the string by concatenating each number and spaces
3. Handle the special case where we don't add a space after the last number

Let me think about the loop invariant:
- At each iteration i, we should have built the string for numbers 0 to i-1
- The string should be properly formatted with spaces

For termination: we're iterating from 0 to n, so `decreases n - i` where i is the loop variable.

Let me write the Dafny code:

```dafny
method string_sequence(n: int) returns (result: string)
    requires n >= 0
    ensures |result| > 0
{
    if n == 0 {
        result := "0";
        return;
    }
    
    result := "0";
    var i := 1;
    while i <= n
        invariant 1 <= i <= n + 1
        invariant |result| > 0
        decreases n - i
    {
        result := result + " " + Int.ToString(i);
        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

I'll need a strategy for integer to string conversion. Dafny doesn't have a built-in method for this, so I'll have to implement a custom conversion or find an alternative approach to building the string sequence.

The core challenge is converting integers to strings and concatenating them efficiently while maintaining the correct format. I'll explore different methods to handle this string construction problem in Dafny.

A recursive or iterative approach to integer to string conversion seems necessary. I'll design a method that can break down an integer into its individual digits and reconstruct it as a string representation.

The implementation requires careful handling of digit extraction and character conversion. I'll use modulo and division operations to systematically extract digits from right to left, then map those digits to character representations.

I recognize the complexity of implementing a robust integer to string conversion in Dafny. The method needs to handle zero, positive integers, and potentially manage character type conversions carefully.

My strategy involves creating a sequence of digits first, then transforming those digits into a character sequence that represents the string. This approach allows for precise control over the conversion process.

The implementation will likely require explicit type casting and careful management of sequence operations to successfully convert integers to their string equivalents.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Function Analysis**: `string_sequence(n: int) -> str` takes an integer `n` and returns a string containing space-delimited numbers from 0 to n inclusive.

2. **Type Mapping**: 
   - Input: `int` → Dafny `int`
   - Output: `str` → Dafny `string`

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - Generate numbers from 0 to n
   - Convert each number to string
   - Join with spaces
   - Examples: n=0 → "0", n=5 → "0 1 2 3 4 5"

4. **Pre-conditions**: Should require `n >= 0` since negative ranges don't make sense

5. **Post-conditions**: 
   - Result should be non-empty
   - Should contain the correct sequence format

6. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Handle n=0 as special case
   - Use a loop to build the string incrementally
   - Need a helper method to convert integers to strings
   - Loop invariant: at iteration i, we've built the string for 0 to i-1
   - Termination: `decreases n - i` where i is the loop counter

    } else {
        s := "";

        var digits: seq<int> := [];
        
        while temp > 0
            invariant temp >= 0
            decreases temp
        {

            temp := temp / 10;
        }
        
        var i := 0;
        while i < |digits|
            invariant 0 <= i <= |digits|
            invariant i == 0 ==> s == ""

            decreases |digits| - i
        {
            var digit_char := (48 + digits[i]) as char; // '0' is ASCII 48
            s := s + [digit_char];
            i := i + 1;
        }
    }

        result := result + " " + num_str;
        i := i + 1;
    }
}
