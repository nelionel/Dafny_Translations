def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this function, I need to generate a string containing space-delimited numbers from 0 to n (inclusive).

Let me analyze the examples:
- `string_sequence(0)` should return `'0'`
- `string_sequence(5)` should return `'0 1 2 3 4 5'`

Here's the implementation:

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    """
    return ' '.join(str(i) for i in range(n + 1))
```

This implementation:
1. Uses `range(n + 1)` to generate numbers from 0 to n inclusive
2. Converts each number to a string using `str(i)`
3. Joins all the string numbers with spaces using `' '.join()`

The function works for any non-negative integer n, creating a space-delimited sequence of numbers from 0 to n.
