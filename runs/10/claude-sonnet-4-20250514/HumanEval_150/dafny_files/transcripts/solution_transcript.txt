=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    """A simple program which should return the value of x if n is 
    a prime number and should return the value of y otherwise.

    Examples:
    for x_or_y(7, 34, 12) == 34
    for x_or_y(15, 8, 5) == 5
    
    """

def x_or_y(n, x, y):

        if num < 2:
            return False
        if num == 2:
            return True
        if num % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
        # Check odd divisors up to sqrt(num)
        for i in range(3, int(num ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    # Return x if n is prime, otherwise return y
    if is_prime(n):
        return x
    else:
        return y
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `x_or_y`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python code:

1. The function `x_or_y(n, x, y)` takes three parameters:
   - `n`: an integer to check if it's prime
   - `x`: a value to return if `n` is prime
   - `y`: a value to return if `n` is not prime

2. The function has a helper function `is_prime(num)` that checks if a number is prime:
   - Returns `False` if `num < 2`
   - Returns `True` if `num == 2`
   - Returns `False` if `num % 2 == 0` (even numbers > 2 are not prime)
   - For odd numbers, checks divisors from 3 to sqrt(num) (inclusive)

3. The main function returns `x` if `n` is prime, otherwise returns `y`.

For the Dafny implementation:
- I need to map the types. The parameters `n`, `x`, and `y` could be integers. From the examples, it looks like they're all integers.
- I need to implement the `is_prime` helper function in Dafny
- I need to provide proper specifications and termination proofs

Let me think about the `is_prime` function:
- It needs a `decreases` clause for the loop. The loop goes from 3 to sqrt(num), so I can use `int(num^0.5) + 1 - i` as the decreases metric.
- Actually, in Dafny I'll need to be careful about the square root calculation. I can use a while loop instead.

For specifications:
- The main function doesn't have strict preconditions, but `n` should probably be non-negative for the prime check to make sense.
- The postcondition should state that the result is `x` if `n` is prime, otherwise `y`.

Let me implement this step by step:


I'll start by creating a predicate for `is_prime` that carefully checks primality using a while loop approach. The implementation will need to handle edge cases like 0, 1, and 2, ensuring correct primality detection. I'll focus on creating a robust method that can prove termination and correctness in Dafny's verification system.

The key will be to construct a method that systematically checks potential divisors while maintaining a clear decreasing metric to satisfy Dafny's termination requirements. This means carefully designing the loop conditions and tracking the search space for potential divisors.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python code:

1. The function `x_or_y(n, x, y)` takes three parameters and returns `x` if `n` is prime, otherwise returns `y`.

2. The helper function `is_prime(num)` checks primality:
   - Returns `False` if `num < 2`  
   - Returns `True` if `num == 2`
   - Returns `False` if `num` is even and > 2
   - For odd numbers, checks divisors from 3 to sqrt(num)

3. From the examples, all parameters appear to be integers.

For the Dafny implementation:
- I need to implement `is_prime` as a predicate with proper termination proof
- The main method should have appropriate specifications
- I need to be careful with the square root calculation and loop termination

The `is_prime` predicate will use a while loop to check divisors, with a decreases clause based on the remaining iterations. The main method will call this predicate and return the appropriate value.

```dafny
predicate is_prime(num: int)
{
    if num < 2 then false
    else if num == 2 then true
    else if num % 2 == 0 then false
    else has_no_odd_divisors(num, 3)
}

predicate has_no_odd_divisors(num: int, divisor: int)
    requires num >= 3
    requires divisor >= 3
    requires divisor % 2 == 1
    decreases if divisor * divisor <= num then num - divisor else 0
{
    if divisor * divisor > num then true
    else if num % divisor == 0 then false
    else has_no_odd_divisors(num, divisor + 2)
}

method x_or_y(n: int, x: int, y: int) returns (result: int)
    ensures result == if is_prime(n) then x else y
{
    if is_prime(n) {
        result := x;
    } else {
        result := y;
    }
}
```
