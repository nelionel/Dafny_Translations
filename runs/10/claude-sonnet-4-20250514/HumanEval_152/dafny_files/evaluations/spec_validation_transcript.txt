=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def compare(game, guess):
    """
    Determines how far off each guess was from the actual game results.
    
    Args:
        game: List of actual game scores
        guess: List of guessed scores
    
    Returns:
        List of absolute differences between guesses and actual scores
    """
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through both arrays simultaneously
    for i in range(len(game)):
        # Calculate absolute difference between actual score and guess
        difference = abs(game[i] - guess[i])
        result.append(difference)
    
    return result
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
method compare(game: seq<int>, guess: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
    requires |game| == |guess|
    ensures |result| == |game|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == abs(game[i] - guess[i])
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] >= 0
{
    result := [];
    var i := 0;
    
    while i < |game|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |game|
        invariant |result| == i
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> result[j] == abs(game[j] - guess[j])
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> result[j] >= 0
        decreases |game| - i
    {
        var difference := abs(game[i] - guess[i]);
        result := result + [difference];
        i := i + 1;
    }
}

function abs(x: int): int
    ensures abs(x) >= 0
    ensures abs(x) == x || abs(x) == -x
    ensures x >= 0 ==> abs(x) == x
    ensures x < 0 ==> abs(x) == -x
{
    if x >= 0 then x else -x
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function and the Dafny specifications:

**Python Function Analysis:**
- Takes two parameters: `game` (list of actual scores) and `guess` (list of guessed scores)
- Iterates through both arrays simultaneously using `range(len(game))`
- For each index i, calculates `abs(game[i] - guess[i])`
- Appends the absolute difference to the result list
- Returns the result list

**Key behaviors:**
1. The function assumes both lists have the same length (it uses `range(len(game))` and accesses both `game[i]` and `guess[i]`)
2. The result list has the same length as the input lists
3. Each element in the result is the absolute difference between corresponding elements
4. All elements in the result are non-negative (due to absolute value)

**Dafny Specifications Analysis:**

**Requires clauses:**
- `requires |game| == |guess|` - This correctly captures that both sequences must have the same length. This is essential because the Python function would crash with an IndexError if they had different lengths.

**Ensures clauses:**
- `ensures |result| == |game|` - This correctly states that the result has the same length as the input sequences
- `ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == abs(game[i] - guess[i])` - This correctly captures that each element is the absolute difference
- `ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] >= 0` - This correctly states that all results are non-negative

**Additional considerations:**
- The `abs` function is properly defined with appropriate specifications
- The loop invariants in the implementation look correct and maintain the postconditions

**Checking completeness:**
1. Preconditions: The Python function implicitly requires that both lists have the same length - this is captured by `|game| == |guess|`


2. Postconditions: The specifications comprehensively validate the function's output. They precisely define the result's length, element calculations, and non-negative constraint. The Dafny specification meticulously mirrors the Python function's core behaviors, ensuring mathematical rigor and correctness.

--- RESPONSE ---
THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS

```dafny
method compare(game: seq<int>, guess: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
    requires |game| == |guess|
    ensures |result| == |game|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == abs(game[i] - guess[i])
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] >= 0
{
    result := [];
    var i := 0;
    
    while i < |game|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |game|
        invariant |result| == i
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> result[j] == abs(game[j] - guess[j])
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> result[j] >= 0
        decreases |game| - i
    {
        var difference := abs(game[i] - guess[i]);
        result := result + [difference];
        i := i + 1;
    }
}

function abs(x: int): int
    ensures abs(x) >= 0
    ensures abs(x) == x || abs(x) == -x
    ensures x >= 0 ==> abs(x) == x
    ensures x < 0 ==> abs(x) == -x
{
    if x >= 0 then x else -x
}
```
