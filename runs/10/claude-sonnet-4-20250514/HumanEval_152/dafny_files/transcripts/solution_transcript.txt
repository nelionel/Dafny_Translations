=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def compare(game,guess):
    """I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
    event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
    definitely worth noting down and comparing.
    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.
    
    
    example:

    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]
    """

def compare(game, guess):
    """
    Determines how far off each guess was from the actual game results.
    
    Args:
        game: List of actual game scores
        guess: List of guessed scores
    
    Returns:
        List of absolute differences between guesses and actual scores
    """
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through both arrays simultaneously
    for i in range(len(game)):
        # Calculate absolute difference between actual score and guess
        difference = abs(game[i] - guess[i])
        result.append(difference)
    
    return result
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `compare`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function step by step:

1. The function takes two lists (game and guess) of equal length
2. It calculates the absolute difference between corresponding elements
3. Returns a list of these absolute differences

Type mapping:
- Python lists with numeric values â†’ Dafny sequences of integers (`seq<int>`)
- The function operates on integers based on the examples

Pre-conditions:
- Both sequences should have the same length
- The sequences should be non-empty (though this isn't strictly required by the logic)

Post-conditions:
- The result sequence has the same length as input sequences
- Each element in the result is the absolute difference of corresponding elements from input sequences
- All elements in result are non-negative (since they're absolute values)

Loop analysis:
- There's a for loop that iterates through indices from 0 to len(game)-1
- Loop invariant: at each iteration i, result contains exactly i elements, each being the absolute difference of corresponding elements from game and guess up to index i-1
- Termination: the loop runs exactly len(game) times, so it terminates

Let me write the Dafny code:

```dafny
method compare(game: seq<int>, guess: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
    requires |game| == |guess|
    ensures |result| == |game|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == abs(game[i] - guess[i])
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] >= 0
{
    result := [];
    var i := 0;
    
    while i < |game|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |game|
        invariant |result| == i
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> result[j] == abs(game[j] - guess[j])
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> result[j] >= 0
    {
        var difference := abs(game[i] - guess[i]);
        result := result + [difference];
        i := i + 1;
    }
}

function abs(x: int): int
{
    if x >= 0 then x else -x
}
```

I'll carefully define a custom absolute value function to ensure it works correctly in Dafny. The implementation handles both positive and negative integers, returning the non-negative magnitude of the input value.

The example inputs confirm my integer-based approach. The test cases show different scenarios of comparing game and guess arrays, with variations in positive and negative numbers. Each comparison generates an array of absolute differences, maintaining the original array length.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Type Analysis**: The function takes two lists of numbers and returns a list of numbers. Looking at the examples, all values are integers, so I'll use `seq<int>` in Dafny.

2. **Logic Analysis**: 
   - Takes two sequences of equal length
   - Calculates absolute difference between corresponding elements
   - Returns sequence of these differences

3. **Pre-conditions**: 
   - Both input sequences must have the same length

4. **Post-conditions**:
   - Result sequence has same length as input sequences
   - Each element is the absolute difference of corresponding input elements
   - All result elements are non-negative (absolute values)

5. **Loop Analysis**:
   - Simple iteration through indices 0 to len(game)-1
   - Loop invariant: result contains correct absolute differences for all processed indices
   - Termination: loop runs exactly |game| times

6. **Helper Function**: Need an `abs` function for absolute value calculation

        var difference := abs(game[i] - guess[i]);
        result := result + [difference];
        i := i + 1;
    }
}

function abs(x: int): int
    ensures abs(x) >= 0
    ensures abs(x) == x || abs(x) == -x
    ensures x >= 0 ==> abs(x) == x
    ensures x < 0 ==> abs(x) == -x

    if x >= 0 then x else -x
