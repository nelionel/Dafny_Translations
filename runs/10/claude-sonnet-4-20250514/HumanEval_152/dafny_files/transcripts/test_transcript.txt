=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `compare`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python
def check(candidate):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert candidate([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2])==[0,0,0,0,3,3], "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate([0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0])==[0,0,0,0,0,0], "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate([1,2,3],[-1,-2,-3])==[2,4,6], "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4])==[2,0,0,1], "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method compare(game: seq<int>, guess: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
    requires |game| == |guess|
    ensures |result| == |game|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == abs(game[i] - guess[i])
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] >= 0
{
    result := [];
    var i := 0;
    
    while i < |game|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |game|
        invariant |result| == i
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> result[j] == abs(game[j] - guess[j])
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> result[j] >= 0
        decreases |game| - i
    {
        var difference := abs(game[i] - guess[i]);
        result := result + [difference];
        i := i + 1;
    }
}

function abs(x: int): int
    ensures abs(x) >= 0
    ensures abs(x) == x || abs(x) == -x
    ensures x >= 0 ==> abs(x) == x
    ensures x < 0 ==> abs(x) == -x
{
    if x >= 0 then x else -x
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`compare`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `compare` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `compare` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```

--- THINKING ---
Looking at the Python test code and the Dafny solution:

1. The method to test is `compare` with signature:
   `method compare(game: seq<int>, guess: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)`

2. The Python tests are:
   - `candidate([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2])==[0,0,0,0,3,3]`
   - `candidate([0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0])==[0,0,0,0,0,0]`
   - `candidate([1,2,3],[-1,-2,-3])==[2,4,6]`
   - `candidate([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4])==[2,0,0,1]`
   - `assert True` (which is always true)

Let me verify these test cases by hand:
1. `[1,2,3,4,5,1]` vs `[1,2,3,4,2,-2]` -> `[|1-1|, |2-2|, |3-3|, |4-4|, |5-2|, |1-(-2)|]` = `[0,0,0,0,3,3]` ✓
2. `[0,0,0,0,0,0]` vs `[0,0,0,0,0,0]` -> `[0,0,0,0,0,0]` ✓
3. `[1,2,3]` vs `[-1,-2,-3]` -> `[|1-(-1)|, |2-(-2)|, |3-(-3)|]` = `[2,4,6]` ✓


4. `[1,2,3,5]` vs `[-1,2,3,4]` -> `[|1-(-1)|, |2-2|, |3-3|, |5-4|]` = `[2,0,0,1]` ✓

I'll create a dummy implementation that returns an empty sequence. For test methods, I'll need to invoke `compare` with test inputs and use `expect` to validate the output matches the expected result.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the Python test code and the Dafny solution:

**Analysis:**
- The method to test is `compare` with signature: `method compare(game: seq<int>, guess: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)`
- The tests verify that `compare` computes the absolute difference between corresponding elements of two sequences
- There are 4 meaningful test cases plus one trivial `assert True`

<dummy>
method compare(game: seq<int>, guess: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
    requires |game| == |guess|
    ensures |result| == |game|
{
    result := [];
}

function abs(x: int): int
{
    if x >= 0 then x else -x
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := compare([1,2,3,4,5,1], [1,2,3,4,2,-2]);
    expect result == [0,0,0,0,3,3];
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := compare([0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0]);
    expect result == [0,0,0,0,0,0];
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := compare([1,2,3], [-1,-2,-3]);
    expect result == [2,4,6];
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := compare([1,2,3,5], [-1,2,3,4]);
    expect result == [2,0,0,1];
}

method {:test} test_4()
{
    // This corresponds to "assert True" - always passes
    expect true;
}
```
