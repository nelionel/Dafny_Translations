You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    """You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions.
    The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The
    strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase
    letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters 
    in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. 
    You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this 
    format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.
    If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should
    choose the one that comes first in the list.
    For example, if you are given "Slices" as the class and a list of the
    extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should
    return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension 
    (its strength is -1).
    Example:
    for Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']) == 'my_class.AA'
    """

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `Strongest_Extension`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Types Analysis:**
   - `class_name` is a string → `string` in Dafny
   - `extensions` is a list of strings → `seq<string>` in Dafny
   - The function returns a string → `string` in Dafny

2. **Logic Analysis:**
   - For each extension, we count uppercase letters (CAP) and lowercase letters (SM)
   - Strength = CAP - SM
   - We want the extension with the highest strength
   - If there's a tie, we take the first one in the list
   - We return `"{class_name}.{strongest_extension}"`

3. **Pre-conditions:**
   - The extensions list must not be empty (since we access `extensions[0]`)

4. **Post-conditions:**
   - The result should be in the format "ClassName.ExtensionName"
   - The chosen extension should be from the input list
   - The chosen extension should have maximum strength among all extensions

5. **Loop invariants:**
   - We need to track the current maximum strength and the strongest extension found so far
   - The strongest extension found so far should be from the extensions we've processed
   - The maximum strength should be the actual strength of the strongest extension found so far

6. **Helper functions needed:**
   - A function to count uppercase letters in a string
   - A function to count lowercase letters in a string
   - A function to calculate strength (CAP - SM)

Let me implement this step by step:

```dafny
method Strongest_Extension(class_name: string, extensions: seq<string>) returns (result: string)
  requires |extensions| > 0
  ensures |result| > 0
{
  var strongest_extension := extensions[0];
  var max_strength := CalculateStrength(extensions[0]);
  
  var i := 1;
  while i < |extensions|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |extensions|
    invariant strongest_extension in extensions[..i]
    invariant max_strength == CalculateStrength(strongest_extension)
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> CalculateStrength(extensions[j]) <= max_strength
  {
    var current_strength := CalculateStrength(extensions[i]);
    if current_strength > max_strength {
      max_strength := current_strength;
      strongest_extension := extensions[i];
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  
  result := class_name + "." + strongest_extension;
  return result;
}
```

I'll complete the implementation by adding the strength calculation logic. The method iterates through extensions, tracking the strongest one based on uppercase and lowercase letter count. It maintains key invariants about the current strongest extension and its strength during the search.

The recursive counting functions will need decreases clauses to prove termination. I'll modify the uppercase and lowercase counting to ensure they reduce the string length with each recursive call.
