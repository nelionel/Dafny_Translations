======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Check if the second word `b` or any of its rotations is a substring of the first word `a`
2. A rotation means moving characters from the beginning to the end (or vice versa)
3. For a string of length n, there are n possible rotations

Let me trace through the examples:
- `cycpattern_check("abcd","abd")` => False: "abd", "bda", "dab" - none are substrings of "abcd"
- `cycpattern_check("hello","ell")` => True: "ell" is directly a substring of "hello"
- `cycpattern_check("abab","baa")` => True: rotations of "baa" are "baa", "aab", "aba" - "aba" is a substring of "abab"

```python
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    """You are given 2 words. You need to return True if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word
    cycpattern_check("abcd","abd") => False
    cycpattern_check("hello","ell") => True
    cycpattern_check("whassup","psus") => False
    cycpattern_check("abab","baa") => True
    cycpattern_check("efef","eeff") => False
    cycpattern_check("himenss","simen") => True
    """
    
    # If b is empty, it's considered a substring of any string
    if not b:
        return True
    
    # If b is longer than a, no rotation of b can be a substring of a
    if len(b) > len(a):
        return False
    
    # Generate all rotations of b and check if any is a substring of a
    for i in range(len(b)):
        rotation = b[i:] + b[:i]
        if rotation in a:
            return True
    
    return False
```

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Handle edge cases: empty `b` returns True, if `b` is longer than `a` returns False
2. Generate all possible rotations of string `b` by taking substrings from position `i` to end, plus substring from start to position `i`
3. Check if each rotation is a substring of `a`
4. Return True if any rotation is found, False otherwise

Time complexity: O(n² × m) where n is length of `b` and m is length of `a`
Space complexity: O(n) for storing rotations
