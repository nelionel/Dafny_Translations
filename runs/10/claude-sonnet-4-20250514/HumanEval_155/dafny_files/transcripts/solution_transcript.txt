You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def even_odd_count(num):
    """Given an integer. return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.

     Example:
        even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)
        even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)
    """

def even_odd_count(num):
    """Given an integer. return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.

     Example:
        even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)
        even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)
    """
    # Convert to absolute value to handle negative numbers
    num = abs(num)
    
    # Convert to string to easily iterate through digits
    num_str = str(num)
    
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Count even and odd digits
    for digit_char in num_str:
        digit = int(digit_char)
        if digit % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
    
    return (even_count, odd_count)
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `even_odd_count`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. The function takes an integer and returns a tuple with the count of even and odd digits
2. It handles negative numbers by taking the absolute value
3. It converts the number to a string to iterate through digits
4. It counts even digits (divisible by 2) and odd digits (not divisible by 2)

For the Dafny translation:
- Input: `int`
- Output: Since Dafny doesn't have tuples and I can't use custom datatypes, I need to return a sequence of integers `seq<int>` where the first element is the even count and the second is the odd count
- Pre-conditions: None really needed, the function should work for any integer
- Post-conditions: 
  - The returned sequence should have exactly 2 elements
  - Both counts should be non-negative
  - The sum of even and odd counts should equal the number of digits in the absolute value of the input

For the implementation:
- I'll need helper functions to convert number to digits and count even/odd
- I'll need to handle the absolute value
- I'll need to iterate through digits

Let me think about the logic:
1. Take absolute value of input
2. Convert to sequence of digits
3. Count even and odd digits
4. Return as sequence [even_count, odd_count]

I'll need helper functions:
- A function to get digits of a number
- A function to check if a digit is even

For termination, when converting number to digits, I'll use a decreasing metric based on the number itself.

--- RESPONSE ---
<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Types**: The function takes an `int` and returns a tuple `(int, int)`. In Dafny, since I can't use custom datatypes in the return signature, I'll return a `seq<int>` with exactly 2 elements where the first is the even count and second is the odd count.

2. **Logic**: 
   - Take absolute value to handle negative numbers
   - Convert to string/digits to iterate through each digit
   - Count digits that are even (divisible by 2) vs odd
   - Return the counts as a pair

3. **Pre-conditions**: No specific requirements - should work for any integer.

4. **Post-conditions**:
   - Return sequence has exactly 2 elements
   - Both counts are non-negative
   - Sum of counts equals total number of digits in the absolute value

5. **Implementation approach**:
   - I'll need a helper function to extract digits from a number
   - I'll need to iterate through digits and count even/odd
   - For termination in digit extraction, I'll use `decreases num` where num gets smaller each iteration

6. **Loop invariants**: When iterating through digits, I need to maintain that the counts so far are correct and non-negative.
