=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def find_max(words):
    """Write a function that accepts a list of strings.
    The list contains different words. Return the word with maximum number
    of unique characters. If multiple strings have maximum number of unique
    characters, return the one which comes first in lexicographical order.

    find_max(["name", "of", "string"]) == "string"
    find_max(["name", "enam", "game"]) == "enam"
    find_max(["aaaaaaa", "bb" ,"cc"]) == "aaaaaaa"
    """
    if not words:
        return ""
    
    max_unique_count = 0
    result = ""
    
    for word in words:
        unique_count = len(set(word))
        
        # If this word has more unique characters, it's our new best
        if unique_count > max_unique_count:
            max_unique_count = unique_count
            result = word
        # If it has the same number of unique characters, check lexicographical order
        elif unique_count == max_unique_count:
            if word < result:
                result = word
    
    return result
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
function UniqueCharCount(s: string): int
{
    |set c | 0 <= c < |s| :: s[c]|
}

method find_max(words: seq<string>) returns (result: string)
    ensures |words| == 0 ==> result == ""
    ensures |words| > 0 ==> result in words
    ensures |words| > 0 ==> forall w :: w in words ==> UniqueCharCount(w) <= UniqueCharCount(result)
    ensures |words| > 0 ==> forall w :: w in words && UniqueCharCount(w) == UniqueCharCount(result) ==> result <= w
{
    if |words| == 0 {
        return "";
    }
    
    var maxUniqueCount := UniqueCharCount(words[0]);
    result := words[0];
    
    var i := 1;
    while i < |words|
        invariant 1 <= i <= |words|
        invariant result in words[..i]
        invariant maxUniqueCount == UniqueCharCount(result)
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> UniqueCharCount(words[j]) <= maxUniqueCount
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i && UniqueCharCount(words[j]) == maxUniqueCount ==> result <= words[j]
        decreases |words| - i
    {
        var currentUniqueCount := UniqueCharCount(words[i]);
        
        if currentUniqueCount > maxUniqueCount {
            maxUniqueCount := currentUniqueCount;
            result := words[i];
        } else if currentUniqueCount == maxUniqueCount && words[i] < result {
            result := words[i];
        }
        
        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function behavior and the Dafny specifications.

**Python Function Analysis:**
1. If the list is empty, return ""
2. Otherwise, find the word with the maximum number of unique characters
3. If multiple words have the same maximum number of unique characters, return the lexicographically smallest one

**Current Dafny Specifications Analysis:**

1. `ensures |words| == 0 ==> result == ""` - This correctly captures that empty input returns empty string.

2. `ensures |words| > 0 ==> result in words` - This correctly captures that the result must be one of the input words.

3. `ensures |words| > 0 ==> forall w :: w in words ==> UniqueCharCount(w) <= UniqueCharCount(result)` - This correctly captures that the result has the maximum number of unique characters.

4. `ensures |words| > 0 ==> forall w :: w in words && UniqueCharCount(w) == UniqueCharCount(result) ==> result <= w` - This correctly captures that among words with the same maximum unique character count, the result is lexicographically smallest.

Let me check if these specifications fully capture the behavior:

1. Empty list handling: ✓ Covered by first ensures clause
2. Result is from input: ✓ Covered by second ensures clause  
3. Result has maximum unique characters: ✓ Covered by third ensures clause
4. Lexicographical ordering for ties: ✓ Covered by fourth ensures clause

The UniqueCharCount function looks correct - it computes the number of unique characters in a string using set comprehension.

Looking at the loop invariants and implementation, they seem to match the postconditions.

Wait, let me double-check the fourth ensures clause:
`ensures |words| > 0 ==> forall w :: w in words && UniqueCharCount(w) == UniqueCharCount(result) ==> result <= w`
 
I see the specification precisely captures the lexicographical ordering requirement. When multiple words share the maximum unique character count, the function selects the lexicographically smallest word. In the example of ["name", "enam", "game"], "enam" would be chosen because it comes first lexicographically among words with the same unique character count.

I'll verify the examples to confirm the implementation. The first test case with ["name", "of", "string"] checks unique character count selection. The second case with ["name", "enam", "game"] validates lexicographical ordering when unique character counts are equal. The third example with ["aaaaaaa", "bb", "cc"] seems to be checking unique character count with single-character repetitions.

The test cases systematically cover different scenarios, ensuring the function handles varied input conditions effectively. Each example provides a distinct perspective on how the selection algorithm should work.
