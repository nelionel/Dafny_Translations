You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def eat(number, need, remaining):
    """
    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,
    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,
                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]
    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
    
    Example:
    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
    * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]
    
    Variables:
    @number : integer
        the number of carrots that you have eaten.
    @need : integer
        the number of carrots that you need to eat.
    @remaining : integer
        the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock
    
    Constrain:
    * 0 <= number <= 1000
    * 0 <= need <= 1000
    * 0 <= remaining <= 1000

    Have fun :)

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `eat`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze this Python function step by step:

1. **Function Analysis:**
   - The function takes 3 integers: `number` (already eaten carrots), `need` (carrots needed), `remaining` (carrots in stock)
   - It returns a list of 2 integers: [total eaten, carrots left]
   - The logic is:
     - Calculate how many carrots can actually be eaten: `min(need, remaining)`
     - Total eaten = already eaten + what can be eaten now
     - Carrots left = remaining - what was eaten

2. **Type Mapping:**
   - Python integers → Dafny `int`
   - Python list of integers → Dafny `seq<int>`

3. **Preconditions:**
   - From the constraints: `0 <= number <= 1000`, `0 <= need <= 1000`, `0 <= remaining <= 1000`

4. **Postconditions:**
   - The result should be a sequence of length 2
   - First element should be `number + min(need, remaining)`
   - Second element should be `remaining - min(need, remaining)`
   - Both elements should be non-negative
   - First element should be at least `number`
   - Second element should be at most `remaining`

5. **Implementation:**
   - No loops or recursion, so no invariants or decreases clauses needed
   - Direct calculation based on the logic

Let me write the Dafny code:

```dafny
method eat(number: int, need: int, remaining: int) returns (result: seq<int>)
    requires 0 <= number <= 1000
    requires 0 <= need <= 1000
    requires 0 <= remaining <= 1000
    ensures |result| == 2
    ensures result[0] == number + if need <= remaining then need else remaining
    ensures result[1] == remaining - (if need <= remaining then need else remaining)
    ensures result[0] >= number
    ensures result[1] >= 0
    ensures result[1] <= remaining
{
    var can_eat := if need <= remaining then need else remaining;
    var total_eaten := number + can_eat;
    var carrots_left := remaining - can_eat;
    result := [total_eaten, carrots_left];
}
```

I'll simplify the implementation by directly using the conditional logic to calculate the amount of carrots that can be eaten. The method ensures that we don't exceed the available carrots while tracking the total number of carrots consumed and those left in stock.

The key insight is using a conditional expression to determine the maximum number of carrots that can be eaten, which becomes the basis for calculating the final result array.

Let me analyze this Python function:

1. **Function Analysis:**
   - Takes 3 integers: `number` (already eaten), `need` (still need to eat), `remaining` (available)
   - Returns a list of 2 integers: [total eaten after meals, carrots left after meals]
   - Logic: eat min(need, remaining), then calculate totals

2. **Type Mapping:**
   - Python integers → Dafny `int`
   - Python list → Dafny `seq<int>`

3. **Preconditions:**
   - From constraints: `0 <= number <= 1000`, `0 <= need <= 1000`, `0 <= remaining <= 1000`

4. **Postconditions:**
   - Result sequence has length 2
   - First element = number + min(need, remaining)
   - Second element = remaining - min(need, remaining)
   - Both elements non-negative
   - Logical relationships between inputs and outputs

5. **Implementation:**
   - No loops/recursion, so no decreases clauses needed
   - Direct calculation using min logic
