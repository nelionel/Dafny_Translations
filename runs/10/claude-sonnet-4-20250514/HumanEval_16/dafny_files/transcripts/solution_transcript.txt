=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python


def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """ Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of
    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
    3
    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
    4
    """

def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """ Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of
    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
    3
    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
    4
    """
    # Convert to lowercase to handle case-insensitivity
    # Use set to get unique characters, then return the count
    return len(set(string.lower()))
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `count_distinct_characters`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. The function takes a string as input and returns an integer
2. It converts the string to lowercase to handle case-insensitivity
3. It creates a set of unique characters from the lowercase string
4. It returns the length (count) of that set

For the Dafny translation:
- Input: `string` (Dafny has a `string` type)
- Output: `int` (number of distinct characters)
- Logic: Need to count unique characters case-insensitively

For the implementation in Dafny:
1. I need to convert the string to lowercase
2. I need to collect unique characters
3. I need to count them

Dafny doesn't have a built-in `set` type that works exactly like Python's set, but I can use `set<char>` to collect unique characters.

For the lowercase conversion, I'll need to implement a helper function or use Dafny's built-in character operations.

Let me think about the preconditions and postconditions:
- Precondition: None really needed, any string is valid
- Postcondition: The result should be >= 0 and <= length of the string

For the implementation:
1. Convert string to lowercase
2. Convert to a set of characters
3. Return the cardinality of the set

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. In Dafny:
- `string` is essentially `seq<char>`
- I can iterate through the characters
- I can build a `set<char>` and return its cardinality

For lowercase conversion, I need to handle each character. Dafny has char operations, so I can check if a character is uppercase and convert it.

Let me implement this step by step:

```dafny
method count_distinct_characters(s: string) returns (count: int)
  ensures count >= 0
  ensures count <= |s|
{
  var lowercase_chars: set<char> := {};
  
  I'll carefully iterate through the string, converting uppercase to lowercase and building a unique set of characters. The loop will systematically process each character, ensuring case-insensitive character collection. I'll maintain an invariant that tracks the lowercase characters and ensures proper iteration through the string's length. The conversion logic handles uppercase letters by shifting their ASCII value, effectively transforming them to lowercase equivalents.
}
```

--- RESPONSE ---
<thinking>
Let me analyze this Python function:

1. **Input/Output Types**: The function takes a `string` and returns an `int`. In Dafny, I can use `string` (which is `seq<char>`) for input and `int` for output.

2. **Logic Analysis**: 
   - Convert string to lowercase for case-insensitivity
   - Use a set to collect unique characters  
   - Return the count of unique characters

3. **Pre/Post-conditions**:
   - No real preconditions needed (any string is valid)
   - Postcondition: result should be >= 0 and <= length of input string

4. **Implementation approach**:
   - Iterate through each character in the string
   - Convert each character to lowercase
   - Add to a set to ensure uniqueness
   - Return the cardinality of the set

5. **Termination**: The while loop will terminate because the index `i` increases each iteration and is bounded by the string length.

6. **Loop invariants**: Need to maintain that the index is within bounds and that the set contains only lowercase characters.
