=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `count_distinct_characters`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python


METADATA = {
    'author': 'jt',
    'dataset': 'test'
}


def check(candidate):
    assert candidate('') == 0
    assert candidate('abcde') == 5
    assert candidate('abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE') == 5
    assert candidate('aaaaAAAAaaaa') == 1
    assert candidate('Jerry jERRY JeRRRY') == 5

```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method count_distinct_characters(s: string) returns (count: int)
  ensures count >= 0
  ensures count <= |s|
{
  var distinct_chars: set<char> := {};
  var i := 0;
  
  while i < |s|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
    invariant forall c :: c in distinct_chars ==> (('a' <= c <= 'z') || ('A' <= c <= 'Z') || ('0' <= c <= '9') || c == ' ' || c == '!' || c == '@' || c == '#' || c == '$' || c == '%' || c == '^' || c == '&' || c == '*' || c == '(' || c == ')' || c == '-' || c == '_' || c == '=' || c == '+' || c == '[' || c == ']' || c == '{' || c == '}' || c == '|' || c == '\\' || c == ':' || c == ';' || c == '"' || c == '\'' || c == '<' || c == '>' || c == ',' || c == '.' || c == '?' || c == '/')
    decreases |s| - i
  {
    var c := s[i];
    var lower_c := if 'A' <= c <= 'Z' then (c as int - 'A' as int + 'a' as int) as char else c;
    distinct_chars := distinct_chars + {lower_c};
    i := i + 1;
  }
  
  count := |distinct_chars|;
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`count_distinct_characters`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `count_distinct_characters` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `count_distinct_characters` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the tests and solution carefully.

From the Python tests:
1. `assert candidate('') == 0` - empty string should return 0
2. `assert candidate('abcde') == 5` - 5 distinct characters
3. `assert candidate('abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE') == 5` - this is 'abcdecadeCADE', should have 5 distinct characters (case insensitive)
4. `assert candidate('aaaaAAAAaaaa') == 1` - all same character, different cases, should be 1
5. `assert candidate('Jerry jERRY JeRRRY') == 5` - should have 5 distinct characters (case insensitive)

Looking at the Dafny solution:
- Method signature: `method count_distinct_characters(s: string) returns (count: int)`
- It converts characters to lowercase and counts distinct characters
- Returns an int count

For the dummy implementation, I need to match the signature:
- `method count_distinct_characters(s: string) returns (count: int)`
- Return a default value of 0

For the tests, I need to:
1. Call `count_distinct_characters` with the appropriate string
2. Use `expect` to check the result

Let me work through the test strings:
1. `''` -> empty string
2. `'abcde'` -> string "abcde"
3. `'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE'` -> string "abcdecadeCADE"
4. `'aaaaAAAAaaaa'` -> string "aaaaAAAAaaaa"
5. `'Jerry jERRY JeRRRY'` -> string "Jerry jERRY JeRRRY"

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the tests and solution, I can see that `count_distinct_characters` is a method that takes a string and returns the count of distinct characters (case-insensitive).

<dummy>
method count_distinct_characters(s: string) returns (count: int)
{
    count := 0;
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := count_distinct_characters("");
    expect result == 0;
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := count_distinct_characters("abcde");
    expect result == 5;
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := count_distinct_characters("abcdecadeCADE");
    expect result == 5;
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := count_distinct_characters("aaaaAAAAaaaa");
    expect result == 1;
}

method {:test} test_4()
{
    var result := count_distinct_characters("Jerry jERRY JeRRRY");
    expect result == 5;
}
```
