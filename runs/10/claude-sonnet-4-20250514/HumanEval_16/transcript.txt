======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

======USER PROMPT======


def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """ Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of
    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
    3
    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
    4
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Count distinct characters in a string regardless of case
2. This means 'x' and 'X' should be considered the same character
3. Return the total count of unique characters

The approach is to:
- Convert the string to lowercase (or uppercase) to handle case-insensitivity
- Use a set to automatically handle uniqueness
- Return the length of the set

```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """ Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of
    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
    3
    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
    4
    """
    # Convert to lowercase to handle case-insensitivity
    # Use set to get unique characters, then return the count
    return len(set(string.lower()))
```

Let me verify with the examples:
- `count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')`: 
  - Lowercase: 'xyzxyz'
  - Set: {'x', 'y', 'z'}
  - Length: 3 ✓

- `count_distinct_characters('Jerry')`:
  - Lowercase: 'jerry' 
  - Set: {'j', 'e', 'r', 'y'}
  - Length: 4 ✓
