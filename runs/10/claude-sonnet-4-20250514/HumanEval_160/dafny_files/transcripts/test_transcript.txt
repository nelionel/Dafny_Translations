=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `do_algebra`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python
def check(candidate):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert candidate(['**', '*', '+'], [2, 3, 4, 5]) == 37
    assert candidate(['+', '*', '-'], [2, 3, 4, 5]) == 9
    assert candidate(['//', '*'], [7, 3, 4]) == 8, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method do_algebra(operator: seq<string>, operand: seq<int>) returns (result: int)
    requires |operator| == |operand| - 1
    requires |operator| >= 1
    requires |operand| >= 2
    requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |operand| ==> operand[i] >= 0
    requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |operator| ==> operator[i] in {"+", "-", "*", "//", "**"}
    ensures result >= 0 ==> result >= 0  // Simple tautology post-condition
{
    // Create working copies that we'll modify during evaluation
    var ops := operator;
    var vals := operand;
    
    // Handle exponentiation first (highest precedence)

    else if exp == 1 then base
    else base * power(base, exp - 1)
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`do_algebra`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `do_algebra` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `do_algebra` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python test code and the Dafny solution:

1. The Dafny method to test is `do_algebra` with signature:
   ```dafny
   method do_algebra(operator: seq<string>, operand: seq<int>) returns (result: int)
   ```

2. The Python tests are:
   - `assert candidate(['**', '*', '+'], [2, 3, 4, 5]) == 37`
   - `assert candidate(['+', '*', '-'], [2, 3, 4, 5]) == 9`
   - `assert candidate(['//', '*'], [7, 3, 4]) == 8`
   - `assert True` (this is always true, so I can create a simple test for it)

3. For the dummy implementation, I need to create a method with the same signature that returns a default value (0 for int).

4. For the tests, I need to convert each assert into a Dafny test method using `{:test}` attribute and `expect` statements.

Let me trace through the expected results to make sure I understand:
- `['**', '*', '+'], [2, 3, 4, 5]` should be `37`
  - First: 2 ** 3 = 8, so we have `['*', '+'], [8, 4, 5]`
  - Next: 8 * 4 = 32, so we have `['+'], [32, 5]`
  - Finally: 32 + 5 = 37
  
- `['+', '*', '-'], [2, 3, 4, 5]` should be `9`
  - No exponentiation
  - Multiplication first: 3 * 4 = 12, so we have `['+', '-'], [2, 12, 5]`
  - Left to right: 2 + 12 = 14, so we have `['-'], [14, 5]`
  - Finally: 14 - 5 = 9

- `['//', '*'], [7, 3, 4]` should be `8`
  - No exponentiation
  - Multiplication and floor division have same precedence, left to right: 7 // 3 = 2, so we have `['*'], [2, 4]`
  - Finally: 2 * 4 = 8

I'll break down the step-by-step calculation process, verifying the arithmetic operations and operator sequence. The test cases demonstrate a complex algebraic evaluation method that applies operations sequentially based on the given operator list. Each example shows a different combination of arithmetic operations, requiring careful order of operations.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the Dafny solution, I can see the method signature is:
```dafny
method do_algebra(operator: seq<string>, operand: seq<int>) returns (result: int)
```

<dummy>
method do_algebra(operator: seq<string>, operand: seq<int>) returns (result: int)
{
    result := 0;
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := do_algebra(["**", "*", "+"], [2, 3, 4, 5]);
    expect result == 37;
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := do_algebra(["+", "*", "-"], [2, 3, 4, 5]);
    expect result == 9;
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := do_algebra(["//", "*"], [7, 3, 4]);
    expect result == 8;
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    // This corresponds to "assert True" which is always true
    expect true;
}
```

=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
The error indicates that there's a duplicate member name `do_algebra`. This means that when the tests are combined with the dummy method, there's already a `do_algebra` method present (likely from the full solution code being included), so my dummy implementation is creating a duplicate.

Since the compilation error shows that `do_algebra` already exists, I should not provide a dummy implementation at all. The full solution code is already available, so I just need to provide the test methods.

Let me just provide the test methods without the dummy implementation.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the compilation error, it appears that the `do_algebra` method already exists in the compilation context (from the full solution), so I don't need to provide a dummy implementation.

<dummy>
// No dummy needed - method already exists
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()

    var result := do_algebra(["**", "*", "+"], [2, 3, 4, 5]);
    expect result == 37;

    expect result == 8;

    // This corresponds to "assert True" which is always true
    expect true;

I see the issue now. The error shows that `do_algebra` is unresolved, which means I do need to provide a dummy implementation. The first error was because I was providing a duplicate, but now the second error shows it's unresolved, meaning I need to provide the dummy.

Looking at the original Dafny solution, the method signature is:
```dafny
method do_algebra(operator: seq<string>, operand: seq<int>) returns (result: int)
```

It has several requires clauses, but for a dummy implementation, I just need the basic signature and return a default value.

Let me provide the dummy implementation and the tests.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the compilation error, I need to provide a dummy implementation of the `do_algebra` method. The method is not found, so I need to create it with the correct signature.

<dummy>
method do_algebra(operator: seq<string>, operand: seq<int>) returns (result: int)
    requires |operator| == |operand| - 1
    requires |operator| >= 1
    requires |operand| >= 2
{
    result := 0;
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := do_algebra(["**", "*", "+"], [2, 3, 4, 5]);
    expect result == 37;
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := do_algebra(["+", "*", "-"], [2, 3, 4, 5]);
    expect result == 9;
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := do_algebra(["//", "*"], [7, 3, 4]);
    expect result == 8;
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    // This corresponds to "assert True" which is always true
    expect true;
}
```
