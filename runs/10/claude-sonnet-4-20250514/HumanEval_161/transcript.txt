======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

======USER PROMPT======

def solve(s):
    """You are given a string s.
    if s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa, 
    otherwise keep it as it is.
    If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.
    The function should return the resulted string.
    Examples
    solve("1234") = "4321"
    solve("ab") = "AB"
    solve("#a@C") = "#A@c"
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Check if the string contains any letters
2. If it contains letters, reverse the case of each letter (lower→upper, upper→lower) and keep non-letters as they are
3. If it contains no letters, reverse the entire string

Let me implement this step by step:

```python
def solve(s):
    """You are given a string s.
    if s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa, 
    otherwise keep it as it is.
    If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.
    The function should return the resulted string.
    Examples
    solve("1234") = "4321"
    solve("ab") = "AB"
    solve("#a@C") = "#A@c"
    """
    # Check if string contains any letters
    has_letters = any(char.isalpha() for char in s)
    
    if not has_letters:
        # If no letters, reverse the entire string
        return s[::-1]
    else:
        # If has letters, reverse case of letters and keep others as is
        result = ""
        for char in s:
            if char.isalpha():
                # Reverse case: lower to upper, upper to lower
                if char.islower():
                    result += char.upper()
                else:
                    result += char.lower()
            else:
                # Keep non-letters as they are
                result += char
        return result
```

The solution works as follows:

1. First, I check if the string contains any letters using `any(char.isalpha() for char in s)`
2. If there are no letters (`not has_letters`), I return the reversed string using slicing `s[::-1]`
3. If there are letters, I iterate through each character:
   - If it's a letter (`char.isalpha()`), I check if it's lowercase or uppercase and convert it to the opposite case
   - If it's not a letter, I keep it unchanged
4. Return the resulting string

This handles all the test cases:
- `solve("1234")` returns `"4321"` (no letters, so reverse)
- `solve("ab")` returns `"AB"` (has letters, so reverse case)
- `solve("#a@C")` returns `"#A@c"` (has letters, so reverse case of letters only)
