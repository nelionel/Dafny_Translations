=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `string_to_md5`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python
def check(candidate):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert candidate('Hello world') == '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'
    assert candidate('') == None
    assert candidate('A B C') == '0ef78513b0cb8cef12743f5aeb35f888'
    assert candidate('password') == '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99'

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method string_to_md5(text: string) returns (result: string)
    ensures text == "" ==> result == ""
    ensures text != "" ==> result != ""
{
    if text == "" {
        return "";
    }
    
    // Since MD5 is not available in Dafny, we implement a simple hash function
    // that produces a deterministic result for demonstration purposes
    var hash_value := simple_hash(text);
    var hex_result := int_to_hex(hash_value);
    
    // Ensure we return a non-empty string for non-empty input
    if hex_result == "" {
        return "1";
    }
    
    return hex_result;
}

// Helper method to compute a simple hash value
method simple_hash(s: string) returns (hash: int)
    ensures hash >= 0
{
    var result := 0;
    var i := 0;
    
    while i < |s|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
        invariant result >= 0
    {
        // Simple hash: sum of character codes multiplied by position
        result := (result + (s[i] as int) * (i + 1)) % 1000000;
        i := i + 1;
    }
    
    if result < 0 {
        result := -result;
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Helper method to convert integer to hexadecimal string
method int_to_hex(n: int) returns (hex: string)
    requires n >= 0
{
    if n == 0 {
        return "0";
    }
    
    var num := n;
    var digits := "0123456789abcdef";
    var result := "";
    
    while num > 0
        invariant num >= 0
        decreases num
    {
        var digit := num % 16;
        result := [digits[digit]] + result;
        num := num / 16;
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`string_to_md5`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `string_to_md5` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `string_to_md5` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python test cases and the Dafny solution:

1. The Python tests are:
   - `candidate('Hello world') == '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'`
   - `candidate('') == None`
   - `candidate('A B C') == '0ef78513b0cb8cef12743f5aeb35f888'`
   - `candidate('password') == '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99'`
   - `assert True` (this is just a trivial assertion)

2. The Dafny method signature from the solution is:
   `method string_to_md5(text: string) returns (result: string)`

3. However, I notice there's a discrepancy. The Python tests expect `None` for empty string, but the Dafny solution returns an empty string `""` for empty input. Also, the Python tests expect specific MD5 hash values, but the Dafny solution uses a simple hash function that won't produce the same results.

For the dummy implementation, I need to create a method with the same signature that returns a default string value.

For the tests, I need to translate each assertion. But there's a problem - the Python test expects `None` for empty string, but Dafny doesn't have `None` for strings. In Dafny, we typically use empty string or some other convention. 

Looking at the Dafny solution, it returns `""` for empty input, so I should test for that. But the Python test expects `None`. This is a mismatch.

Let me check the solution again... The solution has:
```dafny
ensures text == "" ==> result == ""
```

So it returns empty string for empty input, not `None`. Since I'm translating to test the Dafny method, I should test what the Dafny method actually does, not what the Python expects.


I'll focus on creating tests that align with the Dafny method's actual behavior. The key is to match the implementation's specific requirements, not the Python tests' expectations. This means testing the empty string case with an empty string result, and verifying the method works correctly for various input scenarios.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the Python tests and the Dafny solution, I need to analyze the method signature and expected behavior.

The Dafny method signature is: `method string_to_md5(text: string) returns (result: string)`

I notice there's a discrepancy between the Python tests (which expect `None` for empty string) and the Dafny solution (which returns `""` for empty string). Since I'm testing the Dafny method, I'll adapt the tests accordingly.

<dummy>
method string_to_md5(text: string) returns (result: string)
{
    return "";
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := string_to_md5("Hello world");
    expect result == "3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62";
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := string_to_md5("");
    expect result == "";  // Adapted from Python's None to Dafny's empty string
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := string_to_md5("A B C");
    expect result == "0ef78513b0cb8cef12743f5aeb35f888";
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := string_to_md5("password");
    expect result == "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99";
}

method {:test} test_4()
{
    // Translation of "assert True" - always passes
    expect true;
}
```
