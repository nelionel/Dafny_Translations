You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python
from typing import List


def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """ Input to this function is a string representing musical notes in a special ASCII format.
    Your task is to parse this string and return list of integers corresponding to how many beats does each
    not last.

    Here is a legend:
    'o' - whole note, lasts four beats
    'o|' - half note, lasts two beats
    '.|' - quater note, lasts one beat

    >>> parse_music('o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o')
    [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `parse_music`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Function analysis**: The `parse_music` function takes a string representing musical notes and returns a list of integers representing beats.

2. **Types mapping**:
   - Python `str` → Dafny `string`
   - Python `List[int]` → Dafny `seq<int>`

3. **Logic analysis**:
   - If the input string is empty (or just whitespace), return empty list
   - Split the string by spaces to get individual notes
   - Map each note to its beat count using a dictionary:
     - 'o' → 4 beats
     - 'o|' → 2 beats  
     - '.|' → 1 beat
   - For each note, if it's in the mapping, add its beat count to result
   - Return the result

4. **Pre-conditions and post-conditions**:
   - Pre-conditions: None really needed, any string input should be valid
   - Post-conditions: 
     - Result should be a sequence of integers
     - Each integer should be 1, 2, or 4 (valid beat counts)
     - Length should match the number of valid notes in input

5. **Loops**: There's a for loop iterating over the notes. The loop invariant would be that the result so far contains valid beat counts.

6. **Implementation considerations**:
   - Dafny doesn't have a built-in split function, so I'll need to implement string splitting
   - I'll need to implement string trimming to check for empty/whitespace strings
   - I'll need a way to map notes to beat counts

Let me start implementing:

```dafny
method parse_music(music_string: string) returns (result: seq<int>)
{
    // First check if string is empty or just whitespace
    var trimmed := trim(music_string);
    if |trimmed| == 0 {
        return [];
    }
    
    // Split by spaces
    var notes := split_by_space(trimmed);
    
    result := [];
    for i := 0 to |notes|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |notes|
        invariant |result| == i
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> result[j] in {1, 2, 4}
    {
        var beat_count := note_to_beats(notes[i]);
        if beat_count > 0 {
            result := result + [beat_count];
        }
    }
}
```

I'll break down the implementation strategy. The method handles empty inputs by returning an empty sequence. It trims the input to remove whitespace, then splits the string into individual notes. The core logic involves iterating through notes, converting each to its beat count, and building a result sequence. The loop invariants ensure type safety and valid beat counts.

The implementation carefully manages sequence construction, adding only valid beat counts to the result. This approach ensures a clean, predictable transformation of musical notation into beat counts. I'll explore a more direct method for trimming strings, focusing on iterating through characters systematically. I'll track the first and last non-space indices to extract the trimmed substring efficiently. This approach requires careful index management and understanding of string manipulation in Dafny's functional programming paradigm.
