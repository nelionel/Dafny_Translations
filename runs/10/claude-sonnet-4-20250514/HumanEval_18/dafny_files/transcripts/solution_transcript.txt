You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python


def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """ Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string. Count overlaping cases.
    >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
    0
    >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
    3
    >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
    3
    """

def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """ Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string. Count overlaping cases.
    >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
    0
    >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
    3
    >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
    3
    """
    if not substring:  # Handle empty substring case
        return 0
    
    count = 0
    # Check each possible starting position
    for i in range(len(string) - len(substring) + 1):
        if string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `how_many_times`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Function signature**: `how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int`
   - Takes two strings as input
   - Returns an integer count

2. **Logic**: 
   - If substring is empty, return 0
   - Otherwise, iterate through each position in the string where the substring could start
   - For each position i, check if string[i:i+len(substring)] matches substring
   - Count matches and return the count

3. **Types mapping**:
   - Python `str` maps to Dafny `string`
   - Python `int` maps to Dafny `int`

4. **Pre-conditions**: 
   - No specific requirements, both inputs can be any strings

5. **Post-conditions**:
   - Result should be non-negative
   - Result should be correct count of overlapping occurrences

6. **Loop invariants**:
   - The loop goes from 0 to len(string) - len(substring) + 1
   - Need to maintain that count is the number of matches found so far
   - Need to ensure i is within bounds

7. **Termination**:
   - The for loop has a clear termination condition based on the range

Let me write the Dafny implementation:

```dafny
method how_many_times(str: string, substring: string) returns (count: int)
    ensures count >= 0
{
    if |substring| == 0 {
        return 0;
    }
    
    count := 0;
    var i := 0;
    
    while i <= |str| - |substring|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |str| - |substring| + 1
        invariant count >= 0
    {
        if str[i..i + |substring|] == substring {
            count := count + 1;
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

I noticed a potential edge case with string lengths. The current implementation might fail if the input string is shorter than the substring. I'll modify the approach to handle this scenario explicitly by adding a length check before the main counting logic.

The key modification involves adding an early return for cases where the input string is too short to contain the substring. This prevents potential index out-of-bounds issues and ensures robust handling of different input scenarios.

I'll carefully validate the bounds to ensure the counting mechanism works correctly across various input lengths, particularly when the substring is longer than the main string.

The method first checks for an empty substring, immediately returning zero. Then it establishes a critical precondition: only proceed with counting if the main string is at least as long as the substring. This prevents out-of-bounds indexing.

The counting loop iterates through valid starting positions, incrementing the count whenever a substring match is found. The loop invariants guarantee that the index remains within safe bounds and the count stays non-negative.

By structuring the method this way, I ensure robust handling of edge cases like empty strings, short strings, and substring length variations.

Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Function signature**: `how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int`
   - Takes two strings as input
   - Returns an integer count of overlapping occurrences

2. **Logic**: 
   - If substring is empty, return 0
   - Otherwise, iterate through each position in the string where the substring could potentially start
   - For each position i, check if string[i:i+len(substring)] matches substring
   - Count all matches and return the total count

3. **Types mapping**:
   - Python `str` maps to Dafny `string`
   - Python `int` maps to Dafny `int`

4. **Pre-conditions**: 
   - No specific requirements needed, both inputs can be any strings

5. **Post-conditions**:
   - Result should be non-negative (count can't be negative)

6. **Loop analysis**:
   - The loop goes from 0 to len(string) - len(substring) (inclusive)
   - Need invariants to track that the loop variable stays in bounds
   - Need to ensure count remains non-negative
   - Need to handle the case where the string is shorter than the substring

7. **Edge cases**:
   - Empty substring (returns 0)
   - String shorter than substring (returns 0)
   - Empty string (returns 0)
