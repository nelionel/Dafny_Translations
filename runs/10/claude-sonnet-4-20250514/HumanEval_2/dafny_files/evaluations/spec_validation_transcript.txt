=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    0.5
    """
    return number - int(number)
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
method truncate_number(number: real) returns (result: real)
    requires number > 0.0
    ensures 0.0 <= result < 1.0
    ensures result == number - (number as int) as real
{
    result := number - (number as int) as real;
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function and the Dafny specifications:

**Python Function Analysis:**
```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    return number - int(number)
```

The function takes a positive floating point number and returns the decimal part (the fractional part). For example:
- truncate_number(3.5) returns 0.5
- truncate_number(4.7) returns 0.7
- truncate_number(2.0) returns 0.0

The docstring says it's given a "positive floating point number", but let me think about what happens with negative numbers:
- If number = -3.5, then int(-3.5) = -3, so number - int(number) = -3.5 - (-3) = -3.5 + 3 = -0.5

So for negative numbers, the result would be negative. But the docstring specifies "positive floating point number", so the precondition should ensure number > 0.0.

**Dafny Specifications Analysis:**

Current specs:
1. `requires number > 0.0` - This matches the docstring requirement of positive numbers
2. `ensures 0.0 <= result < 1.0` - This is correct for positive numbers. If number > 0, then int(number) <= number < int(number) + 1, so 0 <= number - int(number) < 1.
3. `ensures result == number - (number as int) as real` - This captures the mathematical relationship correctly.

Wait, let me think about edge cases:
- What if number = 0.0? The docstring says "positive", so 0.0 shouldn't be allowed. The current spec has `number > 0.0` which correctly excludes 0.0.
- What if number is exactly an integer like 5.0? Then int(5.0) = 5, so 5.0 - 5 = 0.0, which satisfies 0.0 <= result < 1.0.


I'll verify the Dafny implementation matches the Python function. The line `result := number - (number as int) as real` directly corresponds to the Python `number - int(number)`. The specification ensures the result is a fractional part between 0 and 1, capturing the function's core behavior precisely.

The key points are the mathematical transformation and the constraint on the result's range, which are consistently defined across both implementations.

--- RESPONSE ---
THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS

```dafny
method truncate_number(number: real) returns (result: real)
    requires number > 0.0
    ensures 0.0 <= result < 1.0
    ensures result == number - (number as int) as real
{
    result := number - (number as int) as real;
}
```
