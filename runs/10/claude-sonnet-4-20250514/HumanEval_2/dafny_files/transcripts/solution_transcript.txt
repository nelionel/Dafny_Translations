=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python


def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    0.5
    """

def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    0.5
    """
    return number - int(number)
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `truncate_number`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze this Python function:

1. The function takes a float as input and returns a float
2. It returns the decimal part of the number by subtracting the integer part from the number
3. The function assumes the input is a positive floating point number

For the Dafny translation:
- The input type will be `real` (Dafny's floating point type)
- The output type will be `real`
- The logic is simply `number - int(number)` which in Dafny would be `number - (number as int)` or we need to use floor function

Wait, let me think about this more carefully. In Python, `int(number)` truncates towards zero. For positive numbers, this is the same as floor. But for negative numbers, it's different. However, the documentation says "Given a positive floating point number", so we can assume the input is positive.

In Dafny, we can use the floor operation or we can cast to int. Actually, let me check - in Dafny, when we convert a real to int, it truncates towards zero, similar to Python's int().

For preconditions:
- The number should be positive (as stated in the documentation)

For postconditions:
- The result should be between 0.0 and 1.0 (exclusive of 1.0)
- The result should be number - floor(number)

Let me implement this:

```dafny
method truncate_number(number: real) returns (result: real)
    requires number > 0.0
    ensures 0.0 <= result < 1.0
    ensures result == number - (number as int) as real
{
    result := number - (number as int) as real;
}
```

Actually, let me double-check the casting in Dafny. In Dafny, `number as int` converts a real to an int by truncating towards zero. Then `(number as int) as real` converts it back to a real.


The implementation handles positive inputs precisely, extracting the decimal component through integer truncation.

<thinking>
Let me analyze this Python function:

1. **Function Analysis**: The function takes a positive float and returns the decimal part by subtracting the integer part from the original number.

2. **Type Mapping**: 
   - Python `float` maps to Dafny `real`
   - The function returns a `real`

3. **Logic Analysis**: 
   - `int(number)` in Python truncates towards zero, which for positive numbers is equivalent to floor
   - The result is `number - int(number)`

4. **Preconditions**: 
   - The documentation states the input should be a positive floating point number
   - So `requires number > 0.0`

5. **Postconditions**:
   - The decimal part should be between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive)
   - The result should equal `number - (integer_part_of_number)`

6. **Implementation**: In Dafny, I can use `number as int` to get the integer part (truncated towards zero), then cast back to real and subtract from the original number.

```dafny
method truncate_number(number: real) returns (result: real)
    requires number > 0.0
    ensures 0.0 <= result < 1.0
    ensures result == number - (number as int) as real
{
    result := number - (number as int) as real;
}
```
