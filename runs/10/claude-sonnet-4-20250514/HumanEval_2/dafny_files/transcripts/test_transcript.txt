=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `truncate_number`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python


METADATA = {
    'author': 'jt',
    'dataset': 'test'
}


def check(candidate):
    assert candidate(3.5) == 0.5
    assert abs(candidate(1.33) - 0.33) < 1e-6
    assert abs(candidate(123.456) - 0.456) < 1e-6

```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method truncate_number(number: real) returns (result: real)
    requires number > 0.0
    ensures 0.0 <= result < 1.0
    ensures result == number - (number as int) as real
{
    result := number - (number as int) as real;
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`truncate_number`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `truncate_number` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `truncate_number` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the provided code:

1. The method to test is `truncate_number`
2. Looking at the Dafny solution:
   - Method signature: `method truncate_number(number: real) returns (result: real)`
   - It has a precondition: `requires number > 0.0` 
   - It has postconditions: `ensures 0.0 <= result < 1.0` and `ensures result == number - (number as int) as real`

3. The Python tests are:
   - `assert candidate(3.5) == 0.5`
   - `assert abs(candidate(1.33) - 0.33) < 1e-6`
   - `assert abs(candidate(123.456) - 0.456) < 1e-6`

For the dummy implementation, I need to create a method with the same signature that returns a default real value (0.0).

For the tests:
- test_0: Call truncate_number(3.5) and expect result == 0.5
- test_1: Call truncate_number(1.33) and check that abs(result - 0.33) < 0.000001
- test_2: Call truncate_number(123.456) and check that abs(result - 0.456) < 0.000001

Wait, I need to be careful about the abs function in Dafny. In Dafny, we might need to use if-then-else or a custom abs function for reals.

Actually, let me think about this. In Dafny, for real numbers, I think we can use the built-in abs function or we can implement it ourselves. Let me check what's available... Actually, let me just implement it as a condition using if-then-else to check both directions.

Actually, let me use a simpler approach. For floating point comparisons, I can check if the difference is within the tolerance by checking both directions: `(result - expected) < tolerance && (expected - result) < tolerance` or use `(result - expected).abs < tolerance` if abs is available for reals.
 
I'll verify the availability of the abs function for real numbers in Dafny's standard library. The language likely provides a straightforward way to handle absolute value comparisons for floating-point types.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the method signature and tests, I need to create a dummy implementation and translate the Python assertions.

<dummy>
method truncate_number(number: real) returns (result: real)
{
    result := 0.0;
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := truncate_number(3.5);
    expect result == 0.5;
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := truncate_number(1.33);
    expect (result - 0.33).abs < 0.000001;
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := truncate_number(123.456);
    expect (result - 0.456).abs < 0.000001;
}
```


=============== USER ===============
Your previous attempt failed to generate valid, compilable Dafny code.

Here is the compilation error that occurred when your generated tests were combined with your generated dummy method:
<compilation_error>
temp_compile.dfy(15,27): Error: type real does not have a member abs
   |
15 |     expect (result - 0.33).abs < 0.000001;
   |            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

temp_compile.dfy(21,28): Error: type real does not have a member abs
   |
21 |     expect (result - 0.456).abs < 0.000001;
   |            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

2 resolution/type errors detected in temp_compile.dfy

</compilation_error>

Please analyze the error and provide a complete, fixed response.
You MUST provide BOTH the corrected dummy implementation in a `<dummy>` block AND the corrected, complete test code in a ```dafny ... ``` block.

The error shows that `real` type in Dafny doesn't have an `abs` member method. I need to figure out how to compute absolute value in Dafny. 

Looking at the Python test, it's checking `abs(candidate(1.33) - 0.33) < 1e-6`, which means we need to check if the absolute difference is less than a small epsilon.

In Dafny, I can compute absolute value using a conditional expression: `if x >= 0.0 then x else -x`.

Let me fix the tests:

```dafny
method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := truncate_number(1.33);
    var diff := result - 0.33;
    var abs_diff := if diff >= 0.0 then diff else -diff;
    expect abs_diff < 0.000001;
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := truncate_number(123.456);
    var diff := result - 0.456;
    var abs_diff := if diff >= 0.0 then diff else -diff;
    expect abs_diff < 0.000001;
}
```

The dummy implementation should remain the same.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the compilation error, I see that `real` type in Dafny doesn't have an `abs` member method. I need to compute the absolute value manually using a conditional expression.

<dummy>
method truncate_number(number: real) returns (result: real)
{
    result := 0.0;
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := truncate_number(3.5);
    expect result == 0.5;
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := truncate_number(1.33);
    var diff := result - 0.33;
    var abs_diff := if diff >= 0.0 then diff else -diff;
    expect abs_diff < 0.000001;
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := truncate_number(123.456);
    var diff := result - 0.456;
    var abs_diff := if diff >= 0.0 then diff else -diff;
    expect abs_diff < 0.000001;
}
```
