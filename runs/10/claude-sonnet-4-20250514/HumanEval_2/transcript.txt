def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    0.5
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to extract the decimal part of a positive floating point number. The decimal part is what remains after removing the integer part.

For example:
- 3.5 → integer part is 3, decimal part is 0.5
- 7.123 → integer part is 7, decimal part is 0.123

I can solve this by subtracting the integer part from the original number. The integer part can be obtained using the `int()` function which truncates towards zero.

```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    0.5
    """
    return number - int(number)
```

This implementation:
1. Uses `int(number)` to get the integer part (truncates the decimal portion)
2. Subtracts the integer part from the original number to get the decimal part
3. Returns the decimal part as a float

The function works correctly for the given example: `truncate_number(3.5)` returns `3.5 - 3 = 0.5`.
