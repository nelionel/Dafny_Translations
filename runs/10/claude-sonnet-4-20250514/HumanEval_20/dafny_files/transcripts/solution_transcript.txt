You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = None

        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            diff = abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j])
            if diff < min_diff:
                min_diff = diff
                closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[j])

```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `find_closest_elements`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python code:

1. The function takes a list of floats and returns a tuple of two floats
2. It finds the pair of numbers with the smallest difference
3. It returns them in sorted order (smaller first, larger second)
4. The list must have at least 2 elements

For Dafny:
- List[float] maps to `seq<real>`
- Tuple[float, float] - since I can't use custom datatypes in the return type, I'll return `seq<real>` with exactly 2 elements
- The precondition is that the sequence has at least 2 elements
- The postcondition should ensure that the returned sequence has exactly 2 elements, and they are in non-decreasing order

The algorithm:
1. Initialize min_diff to infinity (I'll use a large real number)
2. Initialize closest_pair to None (I'll track indices instead)
3. Use nested loops to compare all pairs
4. Keep track of the pair with minimum difference
5. Return the pair in sorted order

Loop invariants for the outer loop:
- i ranges from 0 to len(numbers)-1
- We've checked all pairs (x, y) where x is from numbers[0..i-1] and y is from numbers[x+1..len(numbers)-1]

Loop invariants for the inner loop:
- j ranges from i+1 to len(numbers)-1
- We've checked all pairs (numbers[i], numbers[k]) where k is from i+1 to j-1

Let me write the Dafny code:

```dafny
method find_closest_elements(numbers: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<real>)
  requires |numbers| >= 2
  ensures |result| == 2
  ensures result[0] <= result[1]
  ensures exists i, j :: 0 <= i < |numbers| && 0 <= j < |numbers| && i != j && 
          ((result[0] == numbers[i] && result[1] == numbers[j]) || 
           (result[0] == numbers[j] && result[1] == numbers[i]))
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < |numbers| && 0 <= j < |numbers| && i != j ==>
          abs(result[1] - result[0]) <= abs(numbers[j] - numbers[i])
{
  var min_diff := abs(numbers[1] - numbers[0]);
  var closest_i := 0;
  var closest_j := 1;
  
  var i := 0;
  while i < |numbers| - 1
    invariant 0 <= i < |numbers|
    invariant min_diff == abs(numbers[closest_i] - numbers[closest_j])
    invariant 0 <= closest_i < closest_j < |numbers|
  {
    var j := i + 1;
    while j < |numbers|
      invariant i + 1 <= j <= |numbers|
      invariant min_diff == abs(numbers[closest_i] - numbers[closest_j])
      invariant 0 <= closest_i < closest_j < |numbers|
    {
      var current_diff := abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]);
      if current_diff < min_diff {
        min_diff := current_diff;
        closest_i := i;
        closest_j := j;
      }
      j := j + 1;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  
  if numbers[closest_i] <= numbers[closest_j] {
    result := [numbers[closest_i], numbers[closest_j]];
  } else {
    result := [numbers[closest_j], numbers[closest_i]];
  }
}
```

I'll continue the implementation by tracking the algorithm's core steps. The method initializes with the first two elements' difference as the minimum. It then uses nested loops to compare all possible pairs, updating the closest pair whenever a smaller difference is found. The final step ensures the result is returned in sorted order.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python code step by step:

1. **Types**: 
   - `List[float]` maps to `seq<real>` in Dafny
   - `Tuple[float, float]` - since I can't return custom datatypes, I'll return `seq<real>` with exactly 2 elements

2. **Preconditions**:
   - The list must have at least 2 elements (`|numbers| >= 2`)

3. **Postconditions**:
   - Return sequence has exactly 2 elements
   - Elements are in non-decreasing order (smaller first, larger second)
   - The returned pair exists in the original sequence
   - The returned pair has the minimum distance among all pairs

4. **Algorithm**:
   - Compare all pairs of numbers using nested loops
   - Track the pair with minimum difference
   - Return them in sorted order

5. **Loop invariants**:
   - For outer loop: we've processed all pairs where the first element comes from indices 0 to i-1
   - For inner loop: we've processed all pairs (numbers[i], numbers[k]) where k goes from i+1 to j-1
   - We maintain the minimum difference found so far

Let me implement this carefully:

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python code:

1. **Types mapping**: 
   - `List[float]` → `seq<real>` in Dafny
   - `Tuple[float, float]` → `seq<real>` (with exactly 2 elements, since I can't use custom datatypes in return)

2. **Logic analysis**:
   - Find the pair of numbers with minimum absolute difference
   - Return them in sorted order (smaller first, larger second)
   - Requires at least 2 elements in input

3. **Preconditions**: 
   - `|numbers| >= 2`

4. **Postconditions**:
   - Result has exactly 2 elements
   - Result is in non-decreasing order
   - Both elements exist in the original sequence
   - The pair has minimum distance among all possible pairs

5. **Loop invariants**:
   - Outer loop: processed all pairs where first element comes from indices 0..i-1
   - Inner loop: processed all pairs (numbers[i], numbers[k]) where k ∈ [i+1, j-1]
   - Maintain minimum difference and corresponding indices

6. **Termination**: Loops terminate because indices are bounded by sequence length
