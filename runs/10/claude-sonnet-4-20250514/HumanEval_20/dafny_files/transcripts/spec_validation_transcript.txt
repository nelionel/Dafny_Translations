=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple


def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """ From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
    (2.0, 2.2)
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
    (2.0, 2.0)
    """
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = None
    
    # Compare every pair of numbers
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            diff = abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j])
            if diff < min_diff:
                min_diff = diff
                closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[j])
    
    # Return the pair in sorted order (smaller first, larger second)
    return tuple(sorted(closest_pair))
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
function abs(x: real): real
{
  if x >= 0.0 then x else -x
}

method find_closest_elements(numbers: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<real>)
  requires |numbers| >= 2
  ensures |result| == 2
  ensures result[0] <= result[1]
  ensures exists i, j :: 0 <= i < |numbers| && 0 <= j < |numbers| && i != j && 
          ((result[0] == numbers[i] && result[1] == numbers[j]) || 
           (result[0] == numbers[j] && result[1] == numbers[i]))
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < |numbers| && 0 <= j < |numbers| && i != j ==>
          abs(result[1] - result[0]) <= abs(numbers[j] - numbers[i])
{
  var min_diff := abs(numbers[1] - numbers[0]);
  var closest_i := 0;
  var closest_j := 1;
  
  var i := 0;
  while i < |numbers|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant 0 <= closest_i < |numbers| && 0 <= closest_j < |numbers|
    invariant closest_i != closest_j
    invariant min_diff == abs(numbers[closest_j] - numbers[closest_i])
    invariant forall x, y :: 0 <= x < i && x < y < |numbers| ==>
              min_diff <= abs(numbers[y] - numbers[x])
    decreases |numbers| - i
  {
    var j := i + 1;
    while j < |numbers|
      invariant i + 1 <= j <= |numbers|
      invariant 0 <= closest_i < |numbers| && 0 <= closest_j < |numbers|
      invariant closest_i != closest_j
      invariant min_diff == abs(numbers[closest_j] - numbers[closest_i])
      invariant forall x, y :: 0 <= x < i && x < y < |numbers| ==>
                min_diff <= abs(numbers[y] - numbers[x])
      invariant forall y :: i + 1 <= y < j ==>
                min_diff <= abs(numbers[y] - numbers[i])
      decreases |numbers| - j
    {
      var diff := abs(numbers[j] - numbers[i]);
      if diff < min_diff {
        min_diff := diff;
        closest_i := i;
        closest_j := j;
      }
      j := j + 1;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  
  if numbers[closest_i] <= numbers[closest_j] {
    result := [numbers[closest_i], numbers[closest_j]];
  } else {
    result := [numbers[closest_j], numbers[closest_i]];
  }
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function and the Dafny specifications:

**Python Function Analysis:**
1. Takes a list of floats with length at least 2
2. Finds the pair of numbers with the smallest absolute difference
3. Returns them in sorted order (smaller first, larger second)
4. From the examples:
   - `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]` returns `(2.0, 2.2)` because they have the smallest difference
   - `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]` returns `(2.0, 2.0)` because identical elements have difference 0

**Dafny Specifications Analysis:**

**Requires:**
- `requires |numbers| >= 2` - This matches the Python requirement

**Ensures:**
1. `ensures |result| == 2` - Correct, returns a pair
2. `ensures result[0] <= result[1]` - Correct, returns in sorted order
3. `ensures exists i, j :: 0 <= i < |numbers| && 0 <= j < |numbers| && i != j && ((result[0] == numbers[i] && result[1] == numbers[j]) || (result[0] == numbers[j] && result[1] == numbers[i]))` - This ensures the result contains two elements from the input array, which is correct
4. `ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < |numbers| && 0 <= j < |numbers| && i != j ==> abs(result[1] - result[0]) <= abs(numbers[j] - numbers[i])` - This ensures that the difference between the returned pair is minimal among all pairs, which is correct

Let me check if these specifications fully capture the behavior:

1. ✓ Input has at least 2 elements


2. ✓ Output has exactly 2 elements
3. ✓ Output is in sorted order
4. ✓ Output elements come from the input
5. ✓ The output pair has the minimum difference among all pairs

The specifications comprehensively validate the function's core requirements. They ensure the result is a valid pair from the input list, sorted correctly, and representing the smallest absolute difference between any two elements.

The verification confirms that the indices of the selected elements are distinct, guaranteeing the pair comes from unique positions in the original array. This approach captures the essential constraints of finding the closest pair while maintaining the input array's integrity.

The implementation appears robust, systematically addressing the key criteria for selecting the minimum difference pair with precision and clarity.
