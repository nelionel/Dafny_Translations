=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python
from typing import List, Any


def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """ Filter given list of any python values only for integers
    >>> filter_integers(['a', 3.14, 5])
    [5]
    >>> filter_integers([1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []])
    [1, 2, 3]
    """

from typing import List, Any


def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """ Filter given list of any python values only for integers
    >>> filter_integers(['a', 3.14, 5])
    [5]
    >>> filter_integers([1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []])
    [1, 2, 3]
    """
    return [value for value in values if isinstance(value, int) and not isinstance(value, bool)]
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `filter_integers`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze this Python function step by step:

1. **Function purpose**: The function `filter_integers` takes a list of any Python values and returns a list containing only the integer values from the input list.

2. **Key aspects**:
   - Input: `List[Any]` - a list that can contain any Python values
   - Output: `List[int]` - a list containing only integers
   - Logic: The function uses `isinstance(value, int) and not isinstance(value, bool)` to filter for integers but exclude booleans (since in Python, bool is a subclass of int)

3. **Dafny translation considerations**:
   - Since Dafny doesn't have a direct equivalent to Python's `Any` type, I need to think about how to represent this
   - In Dafny, we can use a datatype or union type to represent different possible values
   - However, the requirement states that the return type must be a basic Dafny type, so I should return `seq<int>`
   - For the input, I could use a sequence of a datatype that represents different value types

Actually, let me re-read the requirements. It says "The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type" and "Do not use custom datatypes in the return signature." But it doesn't restrict the input types.

So I can define a datatype for the input to represent different value types (int, real, string, bool), and return `seq<int>`.

Let me define a datatype like:
```dafny
datatype Value = IntValue(i: int) | RealValue(r: real) | StringValue(s: string) | BoolValue(b: bool)
```

Then the function would take `seq<Value>` and return `seq<int>`.

The logic would be:
- Iterate through the input sequence
- For each value, check if it's an IntValue (but not a BoolValue)


- If so, add it to the result sequence

I'll focus on the implementation details for filtering integers. The key is to carefully extract only true integer values while maintaining the original sequence order. I'll need a method that:
- Checks each input value
- Selects only non-boolean integer values
- Builds a new sequence preserving the original order

The specification will require careful handling of the input sequence, ensuring only genuine integers are returned while maintaining their original positioning. I'll filter out integers from the input sequence, preserving their original order while excluding boolean values. The method ensures that each integer in the result corresponds to an integer value in the original sequence, maintaining the relative order and only selecting integer-type elements.

The implementation systematically checks each input value, appending only integer values to the result sequence while tracking the iteration progress through the invariants. This approach guarantees that the output contains precisely the integers from the input, without modifying their original sequence positioning.

<thinking>
Let me analyze this Python function:

1. **Function purpose**: Takes a list of any Python values and returns only the integer values, excluding booleans (since in Python, bool is a subclass of int).

2. **Type mapping**: 
   - Python's `List[Any]` needs to be represented in Dafny. Since Dafny doesn't have a direct `Any` type, I'll create a datatype to represent different possible value types.
   - Return type will be `seq<int>` as required.

3. **Logic analysis**:
   - Filter elements that are integers but not booleans
   - Preserve order of elements
   - No specific preconditions needed
   - Postcondition: result contains only integers from input, in order

4. **Loop considerations**:
   - Single loop iterating through input sequence
   - Loop invariant: partial result contains only integers from processed portion
   - Termination: decreases with remaining elements to process

I'll define a datatype to represent the different value types that could be in the input list, then implement the filtering logic.

```dafny
datatype Value = IntValue(i: int) | RealValue(r: real) | StringValue(s: string) | BoolValue(b: bool)

method filter_integers(values: seq<Value>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  ensures forall x :: x in result ==> exists i :: 0 <= i < |values| && values[i].IntValue? && values[i].i == x
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |values| && values[i].IntValue? ==> values[i].i in result
  ensures |result| <= |values|
{
  result := [];
  var i := 0;
  
  while i < |values|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |values|
    invariant forall x :: x in result ==> exists j :: 0 <= j < i && values[j].IntValue? && values[j].i == x
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i && values[j].IntValue? ==> values[j].i in result
    decreases |values| - i
  {
    if values[i].IntValue? {
      result := result + [values[i].i];
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
}
```
