=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python


def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string
    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> strlen('abc')
    3
    """

def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string
    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> strlen('abc')
    3
    """
    return len(string)
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `strlen`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

Let me analyze the Python function:

1. The function `strlen` takes a string parameter and returns an integer (the length of the string).
2. It simply returns `len(string)` which is the built-in Python function to get string length.
3. The docstring shows test cases:
   - Empty string returns 0
   - String 'abc' returns 3

For the Dafny translation:
- Python `str` maps to Dafny `string`
- Python `int` maps to Dafny `int`
- The function is very simple - it just returns the length of the string

In Dafny, strings are sequences of characters, so `|string|` gives the length.

Preconditions: None needed - any string is valid input.
Postconditions: The result should be non-negative and equal to the length of the string.

No loops or recursion, so no invariants or decreases clauses needed.

Let me write the Dafny code:

```dafny
method strlen(string: string) returns (result: int)
    ensures result >= 0
    ensures result == |string|
{
    result := |string|;
}
```

Wait, let me double-check the requirements:
- Return type must be basic Dafny type: ✓ (int)
- Method name exactly same as Python: ✓ (strlen)
- Concrete implementation: ✓
- No axioms needed: ✓
- No recursion so no decreases needed: ✓
- No reserved keywords as variable names: ✓

This looks correct.

Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Function Analysis**: The `strlen` function takes a string parameter and returns an integer representing the length of that string. It uses Python's built-in `len()` function.

2. **Type Mapping**: 
   - Python `str` → Dafny `string`
   - Python `int` → Dafny `int`

3. **Logic Analysis**: This is a simple function that just returns the length of the input string. In Dafny, string length is obtained using the `|string|` operator.

4. **Preconditions**: None needed - any string is a valid input.

5. **Postconditions**: 
   - The result should be non-negative (string lengths are always >= 0)
   - The result should equal the actual length of the input string

6. **No loops or recursion**: This is a straightforward function with no complex control flow, so no invariants or decreases clauses are needed.

```dafny
method strlen(string: string) returns (result: int)
    ensures result >= 0
    ensures result == |string|
{
    result := |string|;
}
```

Do not provide just the missing pieces - provide the entire solution including any helper functions, the main method, and all specifications.

I see the issues:

1. `string` is a reserved keyword in Dafny, so I can't use it as a parameter name. I need to use a different variable name.

2. The syntax `|string|` for getting the length of a string might not be correct in Dafny. Let me think about the correct way to get string length in Dafny.

Actually, in Dafny, strings are sequences of characters, and the length operator `|s|` should work for sequences. But the issue might be that I'm using `string` as both the type and the parameter name, which is causing a parsing error.

Let me fix both issues:
1. Change the parameter name from `string` to `s` or `str_input`
2. Make sure the length syntax is correct

```dafny
method strlen(s: string) returns (result: int)
    ensures result >= 0
    ensures result == |s|
{
    result := |s|;
}
