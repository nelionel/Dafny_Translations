You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string
    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> strlen('abc')
    3
    """
    return len(string)
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
method strlen(s: string) returns (result: int)
    ensures result >= 0
    ensures result == |s|
{
    result := |s|;
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function and compare it with the Dafny specifications.

Python function:
```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string
    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> strlen('abc')
    3
    """
    return len(string)
```

The Python function:
1. Takes a string as input
2. Returns the length of the string as an integer
3. For empty string, returns 0
4. For 'abc', returns 3
5. The length is always non-negative

Current Dafny code:
```dafny
method strlen(s: string) returns (result: int)
    ensures result >= 0
    ensures result == |s|
{
    result := |s|;
}
```

Let me check if the Dafny specifications properly capture the Python function behavior:

1. **Input**: The Python function takes a string, and the Dafny method takes a string. ✓

2. **Output**: The Python function returns an int, and the Dafny method returns an int. ✓

3. **Behavior**: The Python function returns `len(string)`, which is the length of the string. The Dafny method returns `|s|`, which is also the length of the string in Dafny. ✓

4. **Postconditions**:
   - `ensures result >= 0`: This is correct because string length is always non-negative. ✓
   - `ensures result == |s|`: This correctly specifies that the result equals the length of the input string. ✓

5. **Preconditions**: Are there any preconditions needed?
   - The Python function doesn't have any explicit preconditions
   - In Python, any string is valid input
   - In Dafny, strings are also always valid
   - No preconditions seem necessary

The Dafny specifications appear to fully capture the behavior of the Python function:


I confirm the method's correctness through its key properties. The implementation guarantees a non-negative length matching the input string's exact size. Both language implementations align perfectly, with no additional constraints required for string length calculation.

--- RESPONSE ---
THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS

```dafny
method strlen(s: string) returns (result: int)
    ensures result >= 0
    ensures result == |s|
{
    result := |s|;
}
```
