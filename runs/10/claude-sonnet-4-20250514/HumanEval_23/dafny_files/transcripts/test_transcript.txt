=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `strlen`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python


METADATA = {
    'author': 'jt',
    'dataset': 'test'
}


def check(candidate):
    assert candidate('') == 0
    assert candidate('x') == 1
    assert candidate('asdasnakj') == 9

```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method strlen(s: string) returns (result: int)
    ensures result >= 0
    ensures result == |s|
{
    result := |s|;
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`strlen`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `strlen` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `strlen` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the code:

1. The Python test is checking a function called `candidate` which takes a string and returns its length.
2. The Dafny solution is a method named `strlen` that takes a string and returns an int.
3. The tests are:
   - `assert candidate('') == 0` - empty string should have length 0
   - `assert candidate('x') == 1` - single character string should have length 1  
   - `assert candidate('asdasnakj') == 9` - string "asdasnakj" should have length 9

For the dummy implementation, I need to create a method with the same signature as the solution:
`method strlen(s: string) returns (result: int)`

The dummy should return a default value, which for int would be 0.

For the test methods, I need to:
1. Call the `strlen` method with the test inputs
2. Use `expect` to check the results match expected values

Let me check the string "asdasnakj" - a-s-d-a-s-n-a-k-j = 9 characters, so that's correct.

--- RESPONSE ---
<dummy>
method strlen(s: string) returns (result: int)
{
    result := 0;
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := strlen("");
    expect result == 0;
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := strlen("x");
    expect result == 1;
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := strlen("asdasnakj");
    expect result == 9;
}
```
