=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n
    >>> largest_divisor(15)
    5
    """
    # Check divisors from n//2 down to 1
    for i in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
    
    # This should never be reached for positive integers > 1
    return 1
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
method largest_divisor(n: int) returns (result: int)
    requires n > 1
    ensures result < n
    ensures n % result == 0
    ensures forall k :: result < k < n ==> n % k != 0
{
    var i := n / 2;
    while i > 0
        invariant 0 <= i <= n / 2
        invariant forall k :: i < k <= n / 2 ==> n % k != 0
        decreases i
    {
        if n % i == 0 {
            return i;
        }
        i := i - 1;
    }
    
    return 1;
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function and the Dafny specifications:

**Python function behavior:**
1. Takes an integer n as input
2. Finds the largest number that divides n evenly, which is smaller than n
3. Iterates from n//2 down to 1 and returns the first divisor found
4. If no divisor is found (which should never happen for positive integers > 1), returns 1

**Current Dafny specifications:**
- `requires n > 1` - This captures that we need a positive integer greater than 1
- `ensures result < n` - This ensures the result is smaller than n
- `ensures n % result == 0` - This ensures the result divides n evenly
- `ensures forall k :: result < k < n ==> n % k != 0` - This ensures that there's no larger divisor between result and n

Let me check if these specifications are complete:

1. **Precondition analysis**: The Python function doesn't explicitly check for n > 1, but the logic implies that n should be a positive integer greater than 1 for meaningful results. The `requires n > 1` seems appropriate.

2. **Postcondition analysis**: 
   - `result < n` ✓ - The result should be smaller than n
   - `n % result == 0` ✓ - The result should divide n evenly
   - `forall k :: result < k < n ==> n % k != 0` ✓ - No larger divisor exists

Wait, let me think about this more carefully. The Python function starts from n//2 and goes down to 1. The largest proper divisor of any number n > 1 is at most n/2, so starting from n//2 makes sense.

The specifications look correct:
- The precondition `n > 1` ensures we're working with a meaningful input
- The postconditions ensure that:
  1. The result is smaller than n
  2. The result divides n evenly
  3. No larger divisor exists between result and n

The third postcondition precisely captures the requirement of finding the largest proper divisor by ensuring no number between the result and n can divide n evenly.

--- RESPONSE ---
THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS

```dafny
method largest_divisor(n: int) returns (result: int)
    requires n > 1
    ensures result < n
    ensures n % result == 0
    ensures forall k :: result < k < n ==> n % k != 0
{
    var i := n / 2;
    while i > 0
        invariant 0 <= i <= n / 2
        invariant forall k :: i < k <= n / 2 ==> n % k != 0
        decreases i
    {
        if n % i == 0 {
            return i;
        }
        i := i - 1;
    }
    
    return 1;
}
```
