=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `factorize`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python


METADATA = {
    'author': 'jt',
    'dataset': 'test'
}


def check(candidate):
    assert candidate(2) == [2]
    assert candidate(4) == [2, 2]
    assert candidate(8) == [2, 2, 2]
    assert candidate(3 * 19) == [3, 19]
    assert candidate(3 * 19 * 3 * 19) == [3, 3, 19, 19]
    assert candidate(3 * 19 * 3 * 19 * 3 * 19) == [3, 3, 3, 19, 19, 19]
    assert candidate(3 * 19 * 19 * 19) == [3, 19, 19, 19]
    assert candidate(3 * 2 * 3) == [2, 3, 3]

```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method factorize(n: int) returns (factors: seq<int>)
    requires n >= 0
    ensures n <= 1 ==> |factors| == 0
    ensures n > 1 ==> |factors| > 0
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |factors| - 1 ==> factors[i] <= factors[i + 1]
{
    factors := [];
    
    if n <= 1 {
        return;
    }
    
    var current := n;
    
    // Extract all factors of 2
    while current % 2 == 0
        invariant current > 0
        decreases current
    {
        factors := factors + [2];
        current := current / 2;
    }
    
    // Check odd factors starting from 3
    var factor := 3;
    while factor * factor <= current
        invariant factor >= 3
        invariant factor % 2 == 1
        invariant current > 0
        decreases current - factor + 1000000  // Ensures termination as either current decreases or factor increases
    {
        if current % factor == 0 {
            while current % factor == 0
                invariant current > 0
                decreases current
            {
                factors := factors + [factor];
                current := current / factor;
            }
        }
        factor := factor + 2;
    }
    
    // If current is still greater than 1, then it's a prime factor
    if current > 1 {
        factors := factors + [current];
    }
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`factorize`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `factorize` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `factorize` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python test code and the Dafny solution to understand what I need to do.

From the Python tests, I can see that the `candidate` function is called with:
1. `candidate(2) == [2]`
2. `candidate(4) == [2, 2]`
3. `candidate(8) == [2, 2, 2]`
4. `candidate(3 * 19) == [3, 19]` which is `candidate(57) == [3, 19]`
5. `candidate(3 * 19 * 3 * 19) == [3, 3, 19, 19]` which is `candidate(3249) == [3, 3, 19, 19]`
6. `candidate(3 * 19 * 3 * 19 * 3 * 19) == [3, 3, 3, 19, 19, 19]` which is `candidate(61731) == [3, 3, 3, 19, 19, 19]`
7. `candidate(3 * 19 * 19 * 19) == [3, 19, 19, 19]` which is `candidate(20577) == [3, 19, 19, 19]`
8. `candidate(3 * 2 * 3) == [2, 3, 3]` which is `candidate(18) == [2, 3, 3]`

Looking at the Dafny solution, the method signature is:
```dafny
method factorize(n: int) returns (factors: seq<int>)
```

So I need to:
1. Create a dummy implementation with the same signature
2. Translate the Python assertions to Dafny test methods

Let me calculate the values:
- 3 * 19 = 57


- 3 * 19 * 3 * 19 = 57 * 57 = 3249
- 3 * 19 * 3 * 19 * 3 * 19 = 3249 * 57 = 185193
- 3 * 19 * 19 * 19 = 3 * 6859 = 20577  
- 3 * 2 * 3 = 18

I notice an interesting pattern with the multiplication of prime factors. The calculations confirm the previous test cases, showing how different combinations of prime factors produce specific numbers. The squared term (3 * 19)^2 reveals an intriguing relationship in the factorization process.

The dummy implementation provides a basic framework for factorization, though it currently returns an empty sequence. The method includes preconditions and postconditions that define expected behavior for different input scenarios, particularly for non-negative integers.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the Python tests and the Dafny solution, I need to translate assertions that test the `factorize` method which takes an integer and returns a sequence of prime factors.

<dummy>
method factorize(n: int) returns (factors: seq<int>)
    requires n >= 0
    ensures n <= 1 ==> |factors| == 0
    ensures n > 1 ==> |factors| > 0
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |factors| - 1 ==> factors[i] <= factors[i + 1]
{
    factors := [];
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := factorize(2);
    expect result == [2];
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := factorize(4);
    expect result == [2, 2];
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := factorize(8);
    expect result == [2, 2, 2];
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := factorize(57);
    expect result == [3, 19];
}

method {:test} test_4()
{
    var result := factorize(3249);
    expect result == [3, 3, 19, 19];
}

method {:test} test_5()
{
    var result := factorize(185193);
    expect result == [3, 3, 3, 19, 19, 19];
}

method {:test} test_6()
{
    var result := factorize(20577);
    expect result == [3, 19, 19, 19];
}

method {:test} test_7()
{
    var result := factorize(18);
    expect result == [2, 3, 3];
}
```
