======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

from typing import List


def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Remove elements that occur more than once (appear multiple times)
2. Keep the original order of remaining elements
3. Only keep elements that appear exactly once

Let me trace through the example:
- `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4]`
- 1 appears once → keep
- 2 appears twice → remove all occurrences
- 3 appears once → keep  
- 4 appears once → keep
- Result: `[1, 3, 4]`

```python
from typing import List


def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """
    # Count occurrences of each number
    count = {}
    for num in numbers:
        count[num] = count.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Keep only numbers that appear exactly once, maintaining order
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if count[num] == 1:
            result.append(num)
    
    return result
```
