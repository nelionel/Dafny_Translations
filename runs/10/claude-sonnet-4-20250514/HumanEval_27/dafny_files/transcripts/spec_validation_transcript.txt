=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    """ For a given string, flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase.
    >>> flip_case('Hello')
    'hELLO'
    """
    result = ""
    for char in string:
        if char.islower():
            result += char.upper()
        elif char.isupper():
            result += char.lower()
        else:
            result += char
    return result
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
function IsLowerCase(c: char): bool
{
    'a' <= c <= 'z'
}

function IsUpperCase(c: char): bool
{
    'A' <= c <= 'Z'
}

function ToUpperCase(c: char): char
    requires IsLowerCase(c)
{
    (c as int - 'a' as int + 'A' as int) as char
}

function ToLowerCase(c: char): char
    requires IsUpperCase(c)
{
    (c as int - 'A' as int + 'a' as int) as char
}

method flip_case(s: string) returns (result: string)
    ensures |result| == |s|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> 
        (IsLowerCase(s[i]) ==> result[i] == ToUpperCase(s[i])) &&
        (IsUpperCase(s[i]) ==> result[i] == ToLowerCase(s[i])) &&
        (!IsLowerCase(s[i]) && !IsUpperCase(s[i]) ==> result[i] == s[i])
{
    result := "";
    var i := 0;
    while i < |s|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
        invariant |result| == i
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> 
            (IsLowerCase(s[j]) ==> result[j] == ToUpperCase(s[j])) &&
            (IsUpperCase(s[j]) ==> result[j] == ToLowerCase(s[j])) &&
            (!IsLowerCase(s[j]) && !IsUpperCase(s[j]) ==> result[j] == s[j])
        decreases |s| - i
    {
        var c := s[i];
        if IsLowerCase(c) {
            result := result + [ToUpperCase(c)];
        } else if IsUpperCase(c) {
            result := result + [ToLowerCase(c)];
        } else {
            result := result + [c];
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function and the Dafny specifications.

The Python function `flip_case`:
1. Takes a string as input
2. Returns a string of the same length
3. For each character:
   - If it's lowercase, converts to uppercase 
   - If it's uppercase, converts to lowercase
   - Otherwise, leaves it unchanged

Now let me check the Dafny specifications:

1. The helper functions look correct:
   - `IsLowerCase(c)` checks if c is between 'a' and 'z'
   - `IsUpperCase(c)` checks if c is between 'A' and 'Z'
   - `ToUpperCase(c)` converts lowercase to uppercase (with proper precondition)
   - `ToLowerCase(c)` converts uppercase to lowercase (with proper precondition)

2. The method specifications:
   - `ensures |result| == |s|` - This correctly captures that the result has the same length as input
   - The main postcondition uses a forall to specify behavior for each character:
     - If the original character is lowercase, the result character should be uppercase
     - If the original character is uppercase, the result character should be lowercase
     - If the character is neither, it should remain unchanged

3. Are there any missing preconditions?
   - The Python function doesn't have any preconditions - it works on any string
   - The Dafny method also doesn't have any `requires` clauses, which is correct

4. Do the postconditions fully capture the behavior?
   - Length preservation: ✓
   - Character transformation rules: ✓
   - The logic covers all three cases (lowercase, uppercase, neither): ✓

The specifications look comprehensive and correct. The postcondition properly captures that:
- For each position i in the string
- If the original character is lowercase, the result character is the uppercase version
- If the original character is uppercase, the result character is the lowercase version  


- Unchanged characters preserve their original state when not alphabetic

The implementation demonstrates robust handling of character transformations, ensuring consistent behavior across different input scenarios.
