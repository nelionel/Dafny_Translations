=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python
from typing import List


def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix.
    >>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
    []
    >>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
    ['abc', 'array']
    """

from typing import List


def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix.
    >>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
    []
    >>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
    ['abc', 'array']
    """
    return [string for string in strings if string.startswith(prefix)]
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `filter_by_prefix`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. The function `filter_by_prefix` takes a list of strings and a prefix string as input.
2. It returns a list of strings that contains only those strings from the input list that start with the given prefix.
3. The implementation uses a list comprehension with `string.startswith(prefix)`.

For the Dafny translation:
- `List[str]` maps to `seq<string>`
- `str` maps to `string`
- The function should return `seq<string>`

The logic is straightforward: iterate through the input sequence and filter strings that start with the prefix.

For specifications:
- Pre-conditions: None really needed, as the function should work with any sequence and any prefix
- Post-conditions: 
  - The result should be a subsequence of the input
  - Every string in the result should start with the prefix
  - Every string in the input that starts with the prefix should be in the result

For implementation, I need to check if a string starts with a prefix. In Dafny, I can check this by comparing the first part of the string with the prefix.

Let me think about the `startswith` functionality in Dafny:
- A string `s` starts with prefix `p` if `|s| >= |p|` and `s[0..|p|] == p`

I'll need to implement this as a helper predicate or inline it.

For the main method, I can use a simple loop or recursion to build the result sequence.

Let me implement this step by step:

1. First, I need a way to check if a string starts with a prefix
2. Then iterate through the input sequence and collect matching strings

Here's my approach:
```dafny
predicate StartsWith(s: string, prefix: string)
{
    |s| >= |prefix| && s[0..|prefix|] == prefix
}

method filter_by_prefix(strings: seq<string>, prefix: string) returns (result: seq<string>)
    ensures |result| <= |strings|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> StartsWith(result[i], prefix)
    ensures forall s :: s in result ==> s in strings
    ensures forall s :: s in strings && StartsWith(s, prefix) ==> s in result
{
    result := [];
    for i := 0 to |strings|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |strings|
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < |result| ==> StartsWith(result[j], prefix)
        invariant forall s :: s in result ==> s in strings[0..i]
        invariant forall s :: s in strings[0..i] && StartsWith(s, prefix) ==> s in result
    {
        if StartsWith(strings[i], prefix) {
            result := result + [strings[i]];
        }
    }
}
```

I'll break down the key implementation details:
- Create an empty result sequence
- Iterate through the input sequence
- Check each string against the prefix
- Append matching strings to the result
- Maintain loop invariants to prove correctness

The method ensures:
- Result size doesn't exceed input size
- All result strings start with the prefix
- All result strings come from the input
- All input strings starting with prefix are in the result

--- RESPONSE ---
<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Function analysis**: `filter_by_prefix` takes a list of strings and a prefix string, returning a new list containing only strings that start with the given prefix.

2. **Type mapping**: 
   - `List[str]` → `seq<string>`
   - `str` → `string`
   - Return type: `seq<string>`

3. **Logic**: The function filters strings using `string.startswith(prefix)`. In Dafny, I need to implement string prefix checking manually.

4. **Specifications**:
   - Post-conditions: 
     - All strings in result start with the prefix
     - Result contains only strings from input 
     - Result contains all strings from input that start with the prefix

5. **Implementation approach**: Use a loop to iterate through the input sequence, check each string, and build the result sequence.

6. **String prefix checking**: A string `s` starts with prefix `p` if `|s| >= |p|` and `s[0..|p|] == p`.
</thinking>

```dafny
predicate StartsWith(s: string, prefix: string)
{
    |s| >= |prefix| && (|prefix| == 0 || s[0..|prefix|] == prefix)
}

method filter_by_prefix(strings: seq<string>, prefix: string) returns (result: seq<string>)
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> StartsWith(result[i], prefix)
    ensures forall s :: s in result ==> s in strings
    ensures forall s :: s in strings && StartsWith(s, prefix) ==> s in result
{
    result := [];
    for i := 0 to |strings|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |strings|
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < |result| ==> StartsWith(result[j], prefix)
        invariant forall s :: s in result ==> s in strings[0..i]
        invariant forall s :: s in strings[0..i] && StartsWith(s, prefix) ==> s in result
    {
        if StartsWith(strings[i], prefix) {
            result := result + [strings[i]];
        }
    }
}
```
