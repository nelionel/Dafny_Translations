You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

======USER PROMPT======
from typing import List


def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix.
    >>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
    []
    >>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
    ['abc', 'array']
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this function, I need to filter a list of strings to only include those that start with a given prefix.

```python
from typing import List


def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix.
    >>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
    []
    >>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
    ['abc', 'array']
    """
    return [string for string in strings if string.startswith(prefix)]
```

The implementation uses a list comprehension to iterate through all strings in the input list and only includes those that start with the specified prefix using the `startswith()` method. This handles both edge cases: an empty list returns an empty list, and it correctly identifies strings that begin with the given prefix.
