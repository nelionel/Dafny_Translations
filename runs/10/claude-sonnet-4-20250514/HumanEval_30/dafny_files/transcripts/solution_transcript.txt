=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python


def get_positive(l: list):
    """Return only positive numbers in the list.
    >>> get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6])
    [2, 5, 6]
    >>> get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]
    """

def get_positive(l: list):
    """Return only positive numbers in the list.
    >>> get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6])
    [2, 5, 6]
    >>> get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]
    """
    return [num for num in l if num > 0]
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `get_positive`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. The function `get_positive` takes a list and returns a new list containing only the positive numbers from the input list.
2. Looking at the examples:
   - `get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6])` returns `[2, 5, 6]`
   - `get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])` returns `[5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]`

Note that 0 is not considered positive, so it's excluded from the result.

The logic is: `return [num for num in l if num > 0]`

Now, for the Dafny translation:

**Types:**
- The input `l` is a list of numbers. From the examples, these appear to be integers, so I'll use `seq<int>` in Dafny.
- The return type should also be `seq<int>`.

**Logic:**
- I need to iterate through the input sequence and collect only the positive numbers.
- This can be implemented as a loop that builds a new sequence.

**Specifications:**
- Pre-conditions: There are no specific requirements on the input, so no `requires` clause is needed.
- Post-conditions: The result should contain only positive numbers from the input, and should preserve the order of positive numbers from the input.

**Implementation approach:**
I'll use a while loop to iterate through the input sequence, and build the result sequence incrementally.

**Loop invariants:**
- The index is within bounds
- The result so far contains only positive numbers from the processed part of the input
- The order is preserved

Let me write the Dafny code:

```dafny
method get_positive(l: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] > 0
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] in l
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |l| && l[i] > 0 && l[j] > 0 && 
                         (forall k :: i < k < j ==> l[k] <= 0) ==> 
                         exists x, y :: 0 <= x < y < |result| && result[x] == l[i] && result[y] == l[j]
{
  result := [];
  var i := 0;
  while i < |l|
    invariant 0 <= i <=

I'll continue the implementation by ensuring the loop maintains the key properties of collecting positive numbers while preserving their original order. The additional ensures clauses specify that all elements in the result must be from the original list and maintain their relative positioning among positive numbers.

The method systematically iterates through the input sequence, selectively adding positive elements to the result array. Each iteration carefully tracks the current index and builds a new sequence that meets the specified postconditions.

The loop maintains three key invariants: the result array only contains positive numbers, all result elements originate from the input list, and all previously encountered positive elements are included in the result. This ensures a methodical filtering process that preserves the essential properties of the original sequence.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Function Analysis**: The function `get_positive` takes a list and returns a new list containing only the positive numbers (> 0) from the input list, preserving their order.

2. **Type Mapping**: The input is a list of numbers (from examples, they appear to be integers), so I'll use `seq<int>` in Dafny. The return type will also be `seq<int>`.

3. **Logic**: The function filters the input list to keep only positive numbers using a list comprehension: `[num for num in l if num > 0]`

4. **Specifications**: 
   - No preconditions needed
   - Postconditions should ensure:
     - All elements in result are positive
     - All elements in result come from input
     - All positive elements from input are in result

5. **Implementation**: I'll use a while loop to iterate through the input sequence and build the result incrementally.

6. **Loop Invariants**: 
   - Index bounds
   - Result contains only positive numbers
   - Result elements come from input
   - All processed positive elements are included in result
