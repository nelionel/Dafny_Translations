You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.

I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `poly`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python code and understand what it does:

1. `poly(xs, x)`: Evaluates a polynomial with coefficients in `xs` at point `x`. The polynomial is `xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ... + xs[n] * x^n`.

2. `poly_derivative(xs, x)`: Evaluates the derivative of the polynomial at point `x`. The derivative is `xs[1] + 2*xs[2]*x + 3*xs[3]*x^2 + ...`.

3. `find_zero(xs)`: Uses Newton-Raphson method to find a zero of the polynomial. It starts with an initial guess of 1.0 and iteratively refines it using the formula `x_new = x - f(x)/f'(x)`.

For the Dafny translation:

1. Types:
   - Python `list` → Dafny `seq<real>`
   - Python `float` → Dafny `real`

2. For `poly` method:
   - Input: `seq<real>` and `real`
   - Output: `real`
   - Pre-conditions: The sequence should not be empty (though this isn't strictly required)
   - Post-conditions: Hard to specify without complex mathematical reasoning

3. For `poly_derivative` method:
   - Similar to `poly` but for derivative calculation

4. For `find_zero` method:
   - Input: `seq<real>`
   - Output: `real`
   - Pre-conditions: The sequence should have even length and largest non-zero coefficient (as mentioned in docs)
   - The Newton-Raphson iteration needs loop invariants and termination proof

Let me focus on the main structure. The question asks me to translate the function into a Dafny method, but it looks like there are multiple functions here. I think the main one they want is `find_zero`, but I should implement all three since they're interconnected.


I see now the prompt specifically targets the `poly` function. This means I'll need to carefully translate the polynomial evaluation method, ensuring I capture its core mathematical logic. The function takes a sequence of coefficients and a point, then computes the polynomial's value at that point. I'll need to create a Dafny method that precisely mirrors the Python implementation's mathematical behavior.

For implementation, I'll focus on creating a recursive or iterative approach that systematically multiplies coefficients by increasing powers of the input value. The key will be maintaining the mathematical precision while adapting to Dafny's strict typing and verification requirements.

The Newton-Raphson zero-finding method depends on this polynomial evaluation, so getting `poly` right is crucial for the subsequent functions' correctness. I'll ensure the method handles various polynomial degrees and coefficient configurations robustly.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python code:

1. **Functions provided:**
   - `poly(xs, x)`: Evaluates polynomial with coefficients `xs` at point `x`
   - `poly_derivative(xs, x)`: Evaluates derivative of polynomial at point `x`  
   - `find_zero(xs)`: Uses Newton-Raphson method to find a zero of the polynomial

2. **Type mapping:**
   - Python `list` → Dafny `seq<real>`
   - Python `float` → Dafny `real`

3. **Logic analysis:**
   - `poly`: Straightforward polynomial evaluation using powers
   - `poly_derivative`: Derivative evaluation, skipping the constant term
   - `find_zero`: Iterative Newton-Raphson method with max 1000 iterations

4. **Specifications:**
   - For `poly`: Requires non-empty sequence
   - For `poly_derivative`: Similar to poly
   - For `find_zero`: Requires even-length sequence (as per documentation)

5. **Termination:**
   - `find_zero` uses a bounded loop (max 1000 iterations), so termination is guaranteed

The error is on line 56 where I used `1e-10` which is scientific notation. Dafny doesn't support scientific notation for real literals. I need to use decimal notation instead like `0.0000000001`.

Let me rewrite the entire solution with proper Dafny syntax.
