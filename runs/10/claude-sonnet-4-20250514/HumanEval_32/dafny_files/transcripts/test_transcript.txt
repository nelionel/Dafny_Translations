=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `poly`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python


METADATA = {}


def check(candidate):
    import math
    import random
    rng = random.Random(42)
    import copy
    for _ in range(100):
        ncoeff = 2 * rng.randint(1, 4)
        coeffs = []
        for _ in range(ncoeff):
            coeff = rng.randint(-10, 10)
            if coeff == 0:
                coeff = 1
            coeffs.append(coeff)
        solution = candidate(copy.deepcopy(coeffs))
        assert math.fabs(poly(coeffs, solution)) < 1e-4


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method poly(xs: seq<real>, x: real) returns (result: real)
    requires |xs| > 0
    ensures result == poly_spec(xs, x, 0)
{
    result := 0.0;
    var i := 0;
    while i < |xs|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |xs|
        invariant result == poly_spec(xs, x, i)
        decreases |xs| - i
    {
        var power := pow(x, i);
        result := result + xs[i] * power;
        i := i + 1;
    }
}

function poly_spec(xs: seq<real>, x: real, n: int): real
    requires 0 <= n <= |xs|
    decreases n
{
    if n == 0 then 0.0
    else poly_spec(xs, x, n-1) + xs[n-1] * pow(x, n-1)
}

method poly_derivative(xs: seq<real>, x: real) returns (result: real)
    requires |xs| > 0
{
    result := 0.0;
    var i := 1;
    while i < |xs|
        invariant 1 <= i <= |xs|
        decreases |xs| - i
    {
        var power := if i == 1 then 1.0 else pow(x, i - 1);
        result := result + (i as real) * xs[i] * power;
        i := i + 1;
    }
}

method find_zero(xs: seq<real>) returns (result: real)
    requires |xs| > 0
    requires |xs| % 2 == 0  // even number of coefficients
{
    var x := 1.0;
    var iterations := 0;
    var tolerance := 0.0000000001;  // 1e-10 in decimal form
    
    while iterations < 1000
        invariant 0 <= iterations <= 1000
        decreases 1000 - iterations
    {
        var fx := poly(xs, x);
        var fpx := poly_derivative(xs, x);
        
        // Check if we found the zero (within tolerance)
        if abs_real(fx) < tolerance
        {
            break;
        }
        
        // Avoid division by zero
        if abs_real(fpx) < tolerance
        {
            break;
        }
        
        // Newton-Raphson update: x_new = x - f(x)/f'(x)
        var x_new := x - fx / fpx;
        
        // Check for convergence
        if abs_real(x_new - x) < tolerance
        {
            break;
        }
        
        x := x_new;
        iterations := iterations + 1;
    }
    
    result := x;
}

function pow(base: real, exp: int): real
    requires exp >= 0
    decreases exp
{
    if exp == 0 then 1.0
    else base * pow(base, exp - 1)
}

function abs_real(x: real): real
{
    if x >= 0.0 then x else -x
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`poly`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `poly` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `poly` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the provided Python test code and Dafny solution:

1. The Python test is checking that `poly(coeffs, solution)` returns a value that is very close to 0 (within 1e-4). This appears to be testing that `solution` is indeed a root of the polynomial represented by `coeffs`.

2. Looking at the Dafny solution, I can see that:
   - The `poly` method takes `xs: seq<real>` (coefficients) and `x: real` (the point to evaluate) and returns `result: real`
   - There's also a `find_zero` method that finds roots of polynomials

3. The Python test is calling `candidate(copy.deepcopy(coeffs))` which suggests `candidate` is the `find_zero` method, and then it's checking that `poly(coeffs, solution)` is close to 0.

However, the task asks me to translate tests for the `poly` method specifically. But the Python test is actually testing that a root-finding algorithm works correctly by checking that `poly(coeffs, solution)` is close to 0.

Let me look more carefully at what needs to be tested. The instruction says "The Dafny method you need to test is named `poly`." So I need to create tests for the `poly` method.

But the Python test code doesn't directly test the `poly` method - it tests that a root-finding method returns correct roots. The `poly` method is used to verify that the roots are correct.

I think I need to create tests that test the `poly` method directly. Since the Python code doesn't provide direct tests for `poly`, I'll need to create some reasonable tests based on what the `poly` method does (evaluate a polynomial at a given point).

Actually, let me re-read the task. The Python test code is what I need to translate. The test is checking that `poly(coeffs, solution)` is close to 0, where `solution` is found by the `candidate` function. 

I see the test is incomplete. The logic suggests finding a zero of the polynomial and then verifying that `poly` evaluates to near-zero at that point. This implies testing the polynomial evaluation method by checking its behavior at root points.

The key insight is that the test validates the `poly` method's accuracy by ensuring it returns values extremely close to zero when evaluated at the polynomial's roots. This requires understanding how polynomial root-finding and evaluation interact in the test design.

I'll need to create test cases that directly exercise the `poly` method, focusing on its core functionality of evaluating polynomials at specific input points. The implementation should handle different coefficient sequences and input values systematically.

The dummy implementation provides a starting point, but I'll need to develop more robust tests that comprehensively check polynomial evaluation across various scenarios.

I'll design tests using known polynomials with clear root conditions. For the quadratic x^2 - 1, I'll verify that evaluating at roots 1 and -1 produces values extremely close to zero. This approach will help validate the `poly` method's accuracy and reliability in computing polynomial values.

The tests will involve carefully selecting coefficient sequences and corresponding root values to ensure precise mathematical verification of the polynomial evaluation method.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the Python test code, I can see it's testing that `poly(coeffs, solution)` returns a value very close to 0, where `solution` appears to be a root of the polynomial. The test generates random coefficients, finds a root using some `candidate` function, and then verifies that evaluating the polynomial at that root gives a result close to zero.
