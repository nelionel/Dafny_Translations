======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Extract elements at indices divisible by 3 (0, 3, 6, 9, ...)
2. Sort those elements
3. Put the sorted elements back at the same indices
4. Keep all other elements unchanged

Let me trace through the examples:
- `[1, 2, 3]`: indices 0 has value 1, sort [1] â†’ [1], result: [1, 2, 3]
- `[5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]`: indices 0,3,6 have values [5,4,2], sort to [2,4,5], result: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """
    if not l:
        return []
    
    # Create a copy of the original list
    result = l.copy()
    
    # Extract elements at indices divisible by 3
    third_elements = []
    third_indices = []
    
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            third_elements.append(l[i])
            third_indices.append(i)
    
    # Sort the extracted elements
    third_elements.sort()
    
    # Put the sorted elements back at their respective indices
    for i, index in enumerate(third_indices):
        result[index] = third_elements[i]
    
    return result
