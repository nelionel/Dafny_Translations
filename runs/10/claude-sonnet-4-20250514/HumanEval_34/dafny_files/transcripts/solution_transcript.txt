=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python


def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list
    >>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
    """

def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list
    >>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
    """
    return sorted(list(set(l)))
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `unique`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. The function `unique(l: list)` takes a list as input
2. It returns sorted unique elements in the list
3. The implementation is `return sorted(list(set(l)))`

In Dafny:
- The input type will be `seq<int>` (assuming integers for simplicity)
- The output type will be `seq<int>`
- The function needs to:
  1. Remove duplicates (like Python's `set()`)
  2. Sort the result (like Python's `sorted()`)

For the specification:
- Pre-conditions: None really needed, any sequence is valid input
- Post-conditions: 
  - The result should be sorted
  - The result should contain no duplicates
  - Every element in the result should be in the original sequence
  - Every element in the original sequence should be represented in the result

For implementation, I'll need helper functions:
1. A function to remove duplicates
2. A function to sort

Actually, let me think about this more systematically. I need to implement:
1. Remove duplicates from a sequence
2. Sort the resulting sequence

For removing duplicates, I can iterate through the sequence and only add elements that aren't already in the result.
For sorting, I can use a simple sorting algorithm like insertion sort.

Let me implement these step by step:

1. First, a helper method to check if an element is in a sequence
2. A method to remove duplicates
3. A method to sort
4. The main `unique` method that combines them

Actually, let me be more careful about the types. The Python function doesn't specify the element type, but from the example it looks like integers. I'll use `int` for simplicity.

For termination:
- For removing duplicates: I'll iterate through the input sequence, so termination is based on the length of the input
- For sorting: I'll use insertion sort which has clear termination based on the length of the sequence

--- RESPONSE ---
<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Function Analysis**: The `unique` function takes a list and returns sorted unique elements. It uses `set(l)` to remove duplicates and `sorted()` to sort the result.

2. **Type Mapping**: Since the example shows integers, I'll map the Python `list` to Dafny `seq<int>` and return `seq<int>`.

3. **Specifications**:
   - Pre-conditions: None needed (any sequence is valid input)
   - Post-conditions: 
     - Result is sorted in ascending order
     - Result contains no duplicates
     - Result contains exactly the unique elements from input

4. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - I'll need helper methods for removing duplicates and sorting
   - For removing duplicates: iterate through input, only keep elements not already in result
   - For sorting: use insertion sort algorithm
   - Both need explicit termination proofs

5. **Termination**: Both helper methods will use sequence length as the decreasing metric.
