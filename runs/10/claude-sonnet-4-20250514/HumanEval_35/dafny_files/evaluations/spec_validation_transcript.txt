=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    """
    if not l:  # Handle empty list case
        raise ValueError("Cannot find maximum of empty list")
    
    max_val = l[0]
    for element in l[1:]:
        if element > max_val:
            max_val = element
    
    return max_val
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
method max_element(l: seq<int>) returns (max_val: int)
  requires |l| > 0
  ensures max_val in l
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |l| ==> l[i] <= max_val
{
  max_val := l[0];
  var idx := 1;
  
  while idx < |l|
    invariant 1 <= idx <= |l|
    invariant max_val in l[0..idx]
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < idx ==> l[j] <= max_val
  {
    if l[idx] > max_val {
      max_val := l[idx];
    }
    idx := idx + 1;
  }
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function and the Dafny specifications:

**Python Function Analysis:**
1. The function takes a list as input
2. If the list is empty, it raises a ValueError
3. Otherwise, it finds and returns the maximum element in the list
4. The maximum element is guaranteed to be one of the elements in the list
5. The maximum element is greater than or equal to all other elements in the list

**Current Dafny Specifications Analysis:**
1. `requires |l| > 0` - This correctly captures that the list must be non-empty, which matches the Python function's behavior of raising an error for empty lists.

2. `ensures max_val in l` - This correctly ensures that the returned value is actually an element from the input sequence.

3. `ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |l| ==> l[i] <= max_val` - This correctly ensures that the returned value is greater than or equal to all elements in the sequence.

Let me check if these specifications fully capture the behavior:

1. **Preconditions**: The Python function raises an error for empty lists, and the Dafny spec requires `|l| > 0`. This is correct.

2. **Postconditions**: 
   - The returned value must be in the list: ✓ (`max_val in l`)
   - The returned value must be greater than or equal to all elements: ✓ (`forall i :: 0 <= i < |l| ==> l[i] <= max_val`)

The combination of these two postconditions actually fully defines what it means to be a maximum element:
- It's an element of the list
- It's greater than or equal to all elements in the list

This is exactly what the Python function does - it finds the maximum element.

The specifications look complete and correct. They capture:
1. The precondition (non-empty list)
2. The fact that the result is an element of the input


3. The result represents the true maximum value in the sequence

The Dafny specifications precisely mirror the Python function's core behavior, ensuring both correctness and completeness of the maximum element selection.

--- RESPONSE ---
THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS

```dafny
method max_element(l: seq<int>) returns (max_val: int)
  requires |l| > 0
  ensures max_val in l
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |l| ==> l[i] <= max_val
{
  max_val := l[0];
  var idx := 1;
  
  while idx < |l|
    invariant 1 <= idx <= |l|
    invariant max_val in l[0..idx]
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < idx ==> l[j] <= max_val
  {
    if l[idx] > max_val {
      max_val := l[idx];
    }
    idx := idx + 1;
  }
}
```
