=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python


def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    """

def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    """
    if not l:  # Handle empty list case
        raise ValueError("Cannot find maximum of empty list")
    
    max_val = l[0]
    for element in l[1:]:
        if element > max_val:
            max_val = element
    
    return max_val
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `max_element`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python code:

1. The function `max_element` takes a list and returns the maximum element
2. It first checks if the list is empty and raises a ValueError if it is
3. It then iterates through the list starting from the second element, comparing each element with the current maximum and updating it if necessary
4. It returns the maximum value found

For the Dafny translation:
- The input will be `seq<int>` (I'll assume integers based on the examples)
- The return type will be `int`
- Pre-condition: the sequence must be non-empty (`requires |l| > 0`)
- Post-condition: the returned value should be in the sequence and should be greater than or equal to all elements in the sequence
- Loop invariant: during iteration, `max_val` should be the maximum of elements seen so far
- Termination: the loop will terminate because we're iterating through a finite sequence

Let me write the Dafny code:

```dafny
method max_element(l: seq<int>) returns (max_val: int)
  requires |l| > 0
  ensures max_val in l
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |l| ==> l[i] <= max_val
{
  max_val := l[0];
  var i := 1;
  
  while i < |l|
    invariant 1 <= i <= |l|
    invariant max_val in l[0..i]
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> l[j] <= max_val
  {
    if l[i] > max_val {
      max_val := l[i];
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
}
```

Wait, I need to be careful about the loop invariants. Let me think about this more carefully:

- `max_val` should always be an element from the portion of the sequence we've already processed


- I'll refine the loop invariants to capture the precise relationship between `max_val` and the processed sequence
- The loop's progression needs careful specification to ensure correctness

I'll ensure the loop invariants precisely capture the maximum element property. The key is to show that `max_val` remains the largest element seen so far, and that it's always from the processed portion of the sequence. The termination is guaranteed by the bounded loop variable `i` increasing with each iteration.

--- RESPONSE ---
<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python code:

1. **Function Logic**: The function finds the maximum element in a list. It handles the empty list case by raising an exception, then iterates through the list starting from the first element, keeping track of the maximum seen so far.

2. **Type Mapping**: The Python list will map to `seq<int>` in Dafny (assuming integers based on the examples).

3. **Pre-conditions**: The sequence must be non-empty (`requires |l| > 0`) since the Python code raises an exception for empty lists.

4. **Post-conditions**: 
   - The returned value must be an element in the sequence
   - The returned value must be greater than or equal to all elements in the sequence

5. **Loop Analysis**: The algorithm uses a simple iteration through the sequence. The loop invariant should maintain that:
   - The current `max_val` is from the portion of the sequence already processed
   - `max_val` is greater than or equal to all elements in the processed portion
   - The loop index is within proper bounds

6. **Termination**: The loop terminates because the index increases in each iteration with a finite upper bound.
