You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python


def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
    >>> fizz_buzz(50)
    0
    >>> fizz_buzz(78)
    2
    >>> fizz_buzz(79)
    3
    """

def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
    >>> fizz_buzz(50)
    0
    >>> fizz_buzz(78)
    2
    >>> fizz_buzz(79)
    3
    """
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            # Count occurrences of digit 7 in this number
            count += str(i).count('7')
    
    return count
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `fizz_buzz`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. It takes an integer `n` as input
2. It iterates through numbers from 1 to n-1 (exclusive)
3. For each number, it checks if it's divisible by 11 or 13
4. If it is, it counts how many times the digit '7' appears in that number
5. It returns the total count

So the function signature will be:
```dafny
method fizz_buzz(n: int) returns (count: int)
```

For the requires clause:
- `n` should be non-negative, otherwise the loop doesn't make sense

For the ensures clause:
- The result should be non-negative since we're counting occurrences
- We could also specify that the result is the count of digit 7s in numbers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13

For the loop:
- We need a loop invariant that maintains the count so far
- We need to ensure termination

I also need to implement a helper function to count the occurrences of digit 7 in a number. This can be done by repeatedly dividing by 10 and checking the remainder.

Let me think about how to count digit 7s in a number. I can convert the number to string and count, but in Dafny it's better to do it mathematically:

```dafny
function CountSevens(num: int): int
  requires num >= 0
  decreases num
{
  if num == 0 then 0
  else (if num % 10 == 7 then 1 else 0) + CountSevens(num / 10)
}
```

Actually, let me be more careful about the base case. If num is 0, we should return 0. But what if the original number was 7? Then num % 10 would be 7, and we'd add 1, then call CountSevens(0) which returns 0. 

I'll verify the recursive function's behavior through a detailed trace. For 77, the function correctly identifies both digits as 7, returning 2. The recursive approach systematically breaks down the number, checking each digit against 7 and accumulating the count.

The method works by:
- Checking the last digit with modulo 10
- Adding 1 if the digit is 7
- Recursively processing the remaining digits by integer division
- Stopping when the number becomes 0

For 70, the trace shows a similar pattern, but with only one 7 digit, resulting in a count of 1. This demonstrates the function's precision in counting 7s across different number structures.

The Dafny method's loop structure carefully tracks the count of numbers divisible by 11 or 13, incrementing based on the count of 7s in each qualifying number. The invariants ensure the loop maintains valid state and progress, with the condition i < n matching Python's range behavior.

The edge case of n = 0 requires careful handling, suggesting a potential need for an initial check or adjustment to the method's preconditions to explicitly manage zero input. I see the challenge with the loop invariant when n is 0. The code needs to handle the edge case gracefully, ensuring the method works correctly for zero and positive inputs. By adding an early return for small values, the method avoids loop execution issues and maintains the desired behavior. The invariant is now simplified and more precise, covering the range of valid loop iterations while preserving the count's non-negative property.

The divisibility check for zero reveals a subtle nuance in mathematical interpretation. While technically 0 % 11 is zero, the problem's intent seems to start counting from 1, not including 0. This suggests adjusting the implementation to explicitly start the search from 1, ensuring alignment with the original problem specification.

The method's design handles edge cases like n = 1 elegantly. When n equals 1, the loop condition prevents iteration, naturally setting the count to 0 and maintaining the correct logical invariants. This approach provides a clean, mathematically precise solution that respects the problem's constraints.

I'll carefully define a recursive function to count sevens in a number, ensuring it handles zero and non-zero cases systematically. The implementation breaks down the number digit by digit, incrementing the count when a seven is detected and recursively processing the remaining digits.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Function Analysis**: The function takes an integer `n` and returns an integer count. It iterates through numbers from 1 to n-1, checks if each number is divisible by 11 or 13, and if so, counts how many times the digit '7' appears in that number.

2. **Type Mapping**: The input is `int` and output is `int`, which map directly to Dafny's `int` type.

3. **Pre-conditions**: `n` should be non-negative. Since we iterate from 1 to n-1, we need n >= 1 for the loop to make sense.

4. **Post-conditions**: The result should be non-negative since we're counting occurrences.

5. **Loop Analysis**: 
   - Loop variable `i` goes from 1 to n-1
   - Loop invariant should maintain that `i` is in the valid range and `count` is non-negative
   - Termination: `decreases n - i`

6. **Helper Function**: I need a function to count occurrences of digit 7 in a number. This can be done recursively by checking the last digit and recursing on the number divided by 10.

  count := 0;
  var i := 1;

  {
    if i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0 {
      count := count + CountSevens(i);
    }
    i := i + 1;
