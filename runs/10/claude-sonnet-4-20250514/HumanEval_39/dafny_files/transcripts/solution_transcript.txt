=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `prime_fib`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python code:

1. The function `prime_fib(n: int)` returns the n-th number that is both a Fibonacci number and prime.
2. It uses two helper functions:
   - `is_prime(num)`: checks if a number is prime
   - `fibonacci_generator()`: generates Fibonacci numbers (as a generator)
3. The main logic iterates through Fibonacci numbers, checks if they're prime, and counts until we reach the n-th prime Fibonacci number.

For the Dafny translation:
1. I need to implement the `is_prime` function as a predicate
2. I need to generate Fibonacci numbers (can't use generators in Dafny, so I'll need a different approach)
3. The main function needs to iterate until we find the n-th prime Fibonacci number

Types:
- Input: `int` (maps to `int` in Dafny)
- Output: `int` (maps to `int` in Dafny)

Pre-conditions:
- `n >= 1` (we need at least the first prime Fibonacci number)

Post-conditions:
- The result should be both a Fibonacci number and prime
- It should be the n-th such number

For the implementation:
1. I'll need a function to generate the k-th Fibonacci number
2. I'll need a predicate to check if a number is prime
3. I'll need to iterate through Fibonacci numbers and count the prime ones

Let me think about termination:
- The main loop will terminate because we're counting up to n
- The Fibonacci generation will terminate for each specific index
- The prime checking will terminate because we only check up to sqrt(num)

Loop invariants:
- count <= n
- We've found exactly count prime Fibonacci numbers so far
- The current Fibonacci index is correct

For the Dafny translation:

2. I can't use generators in Dafny, so I'll need to generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively
3. The main function needs to iterate until we find the n-th prime Fibonacci number

Types:
- Input: `int` (maps to `int` in Dafny)  
- Output: `int` (maps to `int` in Dafny)

Pre-conditions:
- `n >= 1` (we need at least the first prime Fibonacci number)

Post-conditions:
- The result should be both a Fibonacci number and prime
- It should be the n-th such number

For implementation:
1. I'll create a function to check if a number is prime
2. I'll generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively while checking for primality
3. I'll count prime Fibonacci numbers until I reach n

Termination considerations:
- The main loop terminates when count reaches n
- The prime checking loop terminates because we only check divisors up to sqrt(num)
