You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """

from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """
    # Calculate the mean of the numbers
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the absolute deviations from the mean
    absolute_deviations = [abs(x - mean) for x in numbers]
    
    # Return the mean of the absolute deviations
    return sum(absolute_deviations) / len(absolute_deviations)
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `mean_absolute_deviation`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function step by step:

1. The function takes a list of floats and returns a float
2. It first calculates the mean of the numbers
3. Then calculates absolute deviations from the mean
4. Finally returns the mean of those absolute deviations

For the Dafny translation:
- `List[float]` maps to `seq<real>` in Dafny
- The function returns a `real`
- We need to ensure the input list is not empty (to avoid division by zero)

Let me think about the pre and post conditions:
- Pre-condition: The sequence must not be empty (|numbers| > 0)
- Post-condition: The result should be non-negative (MAD is always >= 0)

For the implementation:
1. Calculate the sum of all numbers and divide by length to get mean
2. Calculate the sum of absolute differences from mean
3. Divide by length to get the mean absolute deviation

I need helper functions to calculate sums. Let me think about this:
- I'll need a function to sum a sequence of reals
- I'll need a function to calculate absolute value (Dafny has this built-in as `abs`)

Wait, let me check if Dafny has built-in sum. It doesn't, so I need to implement it myself.

Actually, let me implement this step by step:
1. First, I need a sum function for sequences of reals
2. Then I can implement the main function

For the sum function, I'll use recursion with a decreases clause.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python code:

1. **Types**: The function takes a `List[float]` and returns a `float`. In Dafny, this maps to `seq<real>` and `real` respectively.

2. **Logic**: 
   - Calculate the mean of the input numbers
   - Calculate absolute deviations from the mean for each number
   - Return the mean of those absolute deviations

3. **Pre-conditions**: The sequence must not be empty to avoid division by zero.

4. **Post-conditions**: The result should be non-negative since MAD is always >= 0.

5. **Implementation considerations**: 
   - I need helper functions to sum sequences of reals
   - I need to handle the absolute value calculation
   - The main logic involves two passes: one to calculate mean, another to calculate deviations

6. **Termination**: For recursive sum functions, I'll use the length of the sequence as the decreases clause.

    decreases numbers
