def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to implement a function that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) around the mean of a dataset.

The formula is: MAD = average |x - x_mean|

Here's my step-by-step approach:
1. Calculate the mean of the input numbers
2. Calculate the absolute difference between each number and the mean
3. Return the average of these absolute differences

```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """
    # Calculate the mean of the numbers
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the absolute deviations from the mean
    absolute_deviations = [abs(x - mean) for x in numbers]
    
    # Return the mean of the absolute deviations
    return sum(absolute_deviations) / len(absolute_deviations)
```

Let me verify this with the given example:
- Input: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
- Mean: (1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0 + 4.0) / 4 = 2.5
- Absolute deviations: [|1.0-2.5|, |2.0-2.5|, |3.0-2.5|, |4.0-2.5|] = [1.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.5]
- MAD: (1.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.5) / 4 = 4.0 / 4 = 1.0 âœ“
