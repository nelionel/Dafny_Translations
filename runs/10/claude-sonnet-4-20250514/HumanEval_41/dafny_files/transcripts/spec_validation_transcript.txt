=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.
    """
    return n * n
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
method car_race_collision(n: int) returns (result: int)
    requires n >= 0
    ensures result == n * n
{
    result := n * n;
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze this step by step:

1. **Python Function Behavior:**
   - Takes an integer `n` as input
   - Returns `n * n` (n squared)
   - The docstring explains this is modeling car collisions: n cars going left-to-right, n cars going right-to-left, each left-to-right car collides with each right-to-left car, so total collisions = n * n

2. **Current Dafny Specifications:**
   - `requires n >= 0` - requires n to be non-negative
   - `ensures result == n * n` - ensures the result equals n squared

3. **Analysis:**
   - Does the Python function have any implicit preconditions? Looking at the function, it just returns `n * n`. There's no explicit check for n >= 0 in the Python code, so technically it would work for negative integers too (though the real-world interpretation of negative cars doesn't make sense).
   - However, the problem context (number of cars) suggests that n should indeed be non-negative, as you can't have a negative number of cars.
   - The postcondition `result == n * n` correctly captures the return value.

4. **Is the specification complete?**
   - The `requires n >= 0` makes sense given the problem context (number of cars)
   - The `ensures result == n * n` correctly captures the mathematical relationship
   - The specification seems to fully capture the intended behavior

The specifications look correct to me. The function returns n*n, and the precondition that n >= 0 makes sense in the context of counting cars, even though the Python function itself doesn't enforce this.

--- RESPONSE ---
THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS

```dafny
method car_race_collision(n: int) returns (result: int)
    requires n >= 0
    ensures result == n * n
{
    result := n * n;
}
```
