=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1.
    >>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 3, 4]
    >>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
    """
    return [x + 1 for x in l]
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
method incr_list(l: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  ensures |result| == |l|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |l| ==> result[i] == l[i] + 1
  decreases |l|
{
  if |l| == 0 {
    return [];
  } else {
    var rest := incr_list(l[1..]);
    return [l[0] + 1] + rest;
  }
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function and the Dafny specifications:

**Python Function Analysis:**
- The function takes a list of integers
- It returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1
- The length of the output list equals the length of the input list
- For each position i, result[i] = l[i] + 1

**Dafny Specifications Analysis:**
Let me look at the Dafny method:

```dafny
method incr_list(l: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  ensures |result| == |l|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |l| ==> result[i] == l[i] + 1
  decreases |l|
```

The ensures clauses are:
1. `|result| == |l|` - This ensures the result has the same length as the input
2. `forall i :: 0 <= i < |l| ==> result[i] == l[i] + 1` - This ensures that for every valid index i, the result at position i is the input at position i plus 1

Are there any preconditions needed?
- The Python function doesn't have any explicit preconditions
- The function works on any list of integers
- In Dafny, `seq<int>` can be empty or contain any integers, so no special preconditions are needed

Do the postconditions fully capture the behavior?
1. Length preservation: ✓ (covered by `|result| == |l|`)
2. Element transformation: ✓ (covered by `forall i :: 0 <= i < |l| ==> result[i] == l[i] + 1`)

The specifications seem to fully capture the behavior:
- They ensure the result has the same length as the input
- They ensure every element in the result is exactly the corresponding input element plus 1
- These two conditions together fully specify the behavior of incrementing each element


I've verified the edge cases comprehensively. The specifications handle empty lists, single-element lists, and multiple-element lists perfectly. The `decreases |l|` clause supports potential recursive implementation. No additional preconditions or postconditions are necessary, as the current specifications completely capture the function's behavior across all input scenarios.

--- RESPONSE ---
THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS

```dafny
method incr_list(l: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  ensures |result| == |l|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |l| ==> result[i] == l[i] + 1
  decreases |l|
{
  if |l| == 0 {
    return [];
  } else {
    var rest := incr_list(l[1..]);
    return [l[0] + 1] + rest;
  }
}
```
