=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python


def incr_list(l: list):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1.
    >>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 3, 4]
    >>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
    """

def incr_list(l: list):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1.
    >>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 3, 4]
    >>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
    """
    return [x + 1 for x in l]
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `incr_list`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze this Python code step by step.

**Analysis of the Python code:**
1. The function `incr_list` takes a list `l` and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1.
2. From the docstring examples, it looks like it's working with integers.
3. The implementation uses a list comprehension: `[x + 1 for x in l]`
4. There are no explicit type annotations other than `list`, but from the examples, it appears to work with integers.

**Mapping to Dafny types:**
- Python `list` â†’ Dafny `seq<int>` (based on the examples showing integers)
- The function returns a new sequence, so the return type will be `seq<int>`

**Pre-conditions and post-conditions:**
- Pre-conditions: None really needed, any sequence of integers should work
- Post-conditions: 
  - The result sequence has the same length as the input sequence
  - Each element in the result is the corresponding element in the input plus 1

**Loop analysis:**
- In Dafny, I'll need to implement this differently since there's no direct list comprehension. I could use a recursive approach or a loop that builds the result sequence.
- Since sequences in Dafny are immutable, I'll probably use a recursive approach or build it element by element.

**Implementation approach:**
I think a recursive approach would be clean:
- Base case: empty sequence returns empty sequence
- Recursive case: take first element, add 1 to it, and prepend to the result of recursively processing the rest

Let me write the Dafny code:

```dafny
method incr_list(l: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  ensures |result| == |l|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |l| ==> result[i] == l[i] + 1
{
  if |l| == 0 {
    return [];
  } else {
    var rest := incr_list(l[1..]);
    return [l[0] + 1] + rest;
  }
}
```

I'll add a termination proof by specifying the decreases clause to show the recursive call reduces the sequence length. The base case handles empty sequences, while the recursive case breaks down the input sequence, ensuring termination by reducing the sequence length with each recursive call. I'll track each element's index, incrementing values systematically. The loop maintains key invariants: index bounds, result length matching current index, and ensuring each processed element increases by one. By appending incremented values sequentially, I'll construct the transformed list matching the original sequence's structure.

<thinking>
Let me analyze this Python code:

1. **Types**: The function takes a `list` and returns a `list`. From the docstring examples, it works with integers, so I'll use `seq<int>` in Dafny.

2. **Logic**: The function creates a new list where each element is the original element plus 1. This is a straightforward mapping operation.

3. **Pre/Post-conditions**: 
   - No special preconditions needed
   - Post-conditions: result has same length as input, and each element is incremented by 1

4. **Implementation**: Since Dafny doesn't have list comprehensions, I can use either a recursive approach or an iterative loop. I'll use recursion as it's cleaner and more functional in style.

5. **Termination**: For the recursive approach, I need a `decreases` clause based on the sequence length.

```dafny
method incr_list(l: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  ensures |result| == |l|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |l| ==> result[i] == l[i] + 1
  decreases |l|
{
  if |l| == 0 {
    return [];
  } else {
    var rest := incr_list(l[1..]);
    return [l[0] + 1] + rest;
  }
}
