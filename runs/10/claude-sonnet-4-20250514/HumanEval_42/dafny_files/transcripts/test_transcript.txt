=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `incr_list`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python


METADATA = {}


def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([]) == []
    assert candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2]
    assert candidate([5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method incr_list(l: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  ensures |result| == |l|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |l| ==> result[i] == l[i] + 1
  decreases |l|
{
  if |l| == 0 {
    return [];
  } else {
    var rest := incr_list(l[1..]);
    return [l[0] + 1] + rest;
  }
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`incr_list`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `incr_list` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `incr_list` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python test code and the Dafny solution:

1. The method to test is `incr_list`
2. From the Dafny solution, the signature is: `method incr_list(l: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)`
3. The method takes a sequence of integers and returns a sequence of integers where each element is incremented by 1.

Looking at the Python tests:
- `assert candidate([]) == []` - empty list should return empty list
- `assert candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2]` - each element incremented by 1
- `assert candidate([5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]` - each element incremented by 1

Now I need to:
1. Create a dummy implementation with the same signature
2. Translate each assert into a Dafny test method

For the dummy implementation, I need to return a seq<int> with the same signature as the real method. I'll return an empty sequence as the default.

For the tests, I need to:
- Convert Python lists to Dafny sequences using [...]
- Call the incr_list method
- Use expect to check the result

Let me write this out:

--- RESPONSE ---
<dummy>
method incr_list(l: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
{
    return [];
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := incr_list([]);
    expect result == [];
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := incr_list([3, 2, 1]);
    expect result == [4, 3, 2];
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := incr_list([5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]);
    expect result == [6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124];
}
```
