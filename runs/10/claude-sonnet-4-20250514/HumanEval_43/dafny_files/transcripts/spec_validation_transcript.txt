=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    >>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
    False
    >>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
    False
    >>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
    False
    >>> pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7])
    True
    >>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1])
    False
    """
    seen = set()
    
    for num in l:
        # Check if the negative of current number exists in seen set
        if -num in seen:
            return True
        # Add current number to seen set
        seen.add(num)
    
    return False
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
predicate Contains(s: seq<int>, x: int)
{
    exists i :: 0 <= i < |s| && s[i] == x
}

method pairs_sum_to_zero(l: seq<int>) returns (result: bool)
    ensures result <==> (exists i, j :: 0 <= i < |l| && 0 <= j < |l| && i != j && l[i] + l[j] == 0)
{
    var seen: seq<int> := [];
    var index := 0;
    
    while index < |l|
        invariant 0 <= index <= |l|
        invariant |seen| == index
        invariant forall k :: 0 <= k < index ==> seen[k] == l[k]
        invariant forall i, j :: 0 <= i < index && 0 <= j < index && i != j ==> l[i] + l[j] != 0
        decreases |l| - index
    {
        var num := l[index];
        
        if Contains(seen, -num) {
            return true;
        }
        
        seen := seen + [num];
        index := index + 1;
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function and the Dafny specifications.

**Python Function Analysis:**
The Python function `pairs_sum_to_zero` takes a list of integers and returns True if there are two distinct elements that sum to zero, False otherwise.

The algorithm:
1. Uses a set `seen` to track numbers we've already encountered
2. For each number `num` in the list:
   - If `-num` is already in `seen`, return True (we found a pair that sums to zero)
   - Otherwise, add `num` to `seen`
3. If we go through the entire list without finding a pair, return False

**Dafny Code Analysis:**
The `ensures` clause states:
```dafny
ensures result <==> (exists i, j :: 0 <= i < |l| && 0 <= j < |l| && i != j && l[i] + l[j] == 0)
```

This says the result is true if and only if there exist two distinct indices i and j such that the elements at those indices sum to zero.

Let me check if this correctly captures the Python behavior:

1. The Python function returns True if there are two distinct elements that sum to zero
2. The Dafny ensures clause says result is true iff there exist two distinct indices with elements that sum to zero

This seems correct. The key question is whether "distinct elements" means "elements at distinct positions" or "elements with different values". Looking at the Python code and the examples:

- `[1, 3, -2, 1]` returns False - this suggests that even though we have 1 and -1 is not present, it returns False
- `[2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]` returns True - this has 5 and -5, so it returns True

Wait, let me trace through the examples:

1. `[1, 3, 5, 0]` - False


I'll trace the set operations step by step. Initially, the set is empty. As we iterate through the list, we add each number to the set and check for its negative counterpart. No pair sums to zero, so the function returns False.

2. `[1, 3, -2, 1]`
I'll carefully examine how the set changes and whether any pair sums to zero. The presence of duplicate elements adds complexity to the tracking process.

3. `[2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]`
This example demonstrates a successful case where a pair exists that sums to zero. Specifically, -5 and 5 are present in the set, triggering an early return of True.

The core logic involves tracking unique elements and checking for complementary values that would create a zero sum.

I'll examine the preconditions and loop invariants carefully. The function handles various input scenarios robustly, including empty and single-element lists. The Dafny invariant ensures no zero-sum pairs exist before the current index, which validates the algorithm's correctness.

The ensures clause precisely captures the function's behavior, confirming the specification matches the implementation's intent.

THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS

```dafny

{
    exists i :: 0 <= i < |s| && s[i] == x
}

    ensures result <==> (exists i, j :: 0 <= i < |l| && 0 <= j < |l| && i != j && l[i] + l[j] == 0)
{
    var seen: seq<int> := [];
    var index := 0;
    
    while index < |l|
        invariant 0 <= index <= |l|
        invariant |seen| == index
        invariant forall k :: 0 <= k < index ==> seen[k] == l[k]
        invariant forall i, j :: 0 <= i < index && 0 <= j < index && i != j ==> l[i] + l[j] != 0
        decreases |l| - index
    {
        var num := l[index];
        
        if Contains(seen, -num) {
            return true;
        }
        
        seen := seen + [num];
        index := index + 1;
    }
    
    return false;
