You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python


def change_base(x: int, base: int):
    """Change numerical base of input number x to base.
    return string representation after the conversion.
    base numbers are less than 10.
    >>> change_base(8, 3)
    '22'
    >>> change_base(8, 2)
    '1000'
    >>> change_base(7, 2)
    '111'
    """

def change_base(x: int, base: int):
    """Change numerical base of input number x to base.
    return string representation after the conversion.
    base numbers are less than 10.
    >>> change_base(8, 3)
    '22'
    >>> change_base(8, 2)
    '1000'
    >>> change_base(7, 2)
    '111'
    """
    if x == 0:
        return "0"
    
    digits = []
    while x > 0:
        digits.append(str(x % base))
        x //= base
    
    return ''.join(reversed(digits))
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `change_base`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze this Python function:

```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int):
    """Change numerical base of input number x to base.
    return string representation after the conversion.
    base numbers are less than 10.
    >>> change_base(8, 3)
    '22'
    >>> change_base(8, 2)
    '1000'
    >>> change_base(7, 2)
    '111'
    """
    if x == 0:
        return "0"
    
    digits = []
    while x > 0:
        digits.append(str(x % base))
        x //= base
    
    return ''.join(reversed(digits))
```

The function converts a number x from base 10 to the specified base, returning a string representation.

The logic is:
1. If x is 0, return "0"
2. Otherwise, repeatedly take x % base to get digits, and divide x by base
3. The digits are collected in reverse order, so we need to reverse them
4. Convert digits to strings and join them

For Dafny:
- x: int
- base: int  
- return: string

Preconditions:
- x >= 0 (since we're dealing with positive numbers and 0)
- base >= 2 (need at least base 2)
- base < 10 (as stated in docstring, base numbers are less than 10)

Loop invariants:
- x >= 0
- base >= 2
- The digits collected so far represent the correct conversion

The loop terminates because x decreases in each iteration (x //= base) and x >= 0.

Let me write the Dafny code:

```dafny
method change_base(x: int, base: int) returns (result: string)
    requires x >= 0
    requires 2 <= base < 10
    ensures |result| >= 1
{
    if x == 0 {
        return "0";
    }
    
    var digits: seq<int> := [];
    var temp_x := x;
    
    while temp_x > 0
        invariant temp_x >= 0
        invariant base >= 2
        decreases temp_x
    {
        var digit := temp_x % base;
        digits := digits + [digit];
        temp_x := temp_x / base;
    }
    
    // Now reverse the digits and convert to string
    var reversed_digits: seq<int> := [];
    
I'll continue the Dafny implementation by reversing the collected digits and converting them to a string representation. The process involves iterating through the original digit sequence in reverse order and building a new sequence of reversed digits.

Next, I'll convert each reversed digit to its corresponding character representation, handling digits from 0 to 8 with a series of conditional checks. This approach ensures a precise mapping of numeric digits to their string equivalents.

I'm now reconsidering my previous implementation and seeking a more direct method for base conversion. The new approach will eliminate the separate reversal step, instead building the digit sequence more efficiently during the conversion process. I'll start by handling the special case of zero, then create a dynamic sequence to capture digits as I divide the input number.

The method will require careful management of the temporary variable tracking the remaining value, ensuring I can extract digits systematically while maintaining the invariant that the original number is progressively reduced.

By prepending each converted digit character to the sequence, I'll naturally construct the result in the correct order without an explicit reversal operation. This approach simplifies the logic and reduces the potential for errors in the conversion process.

The implementation will carefully convert each extracted digit to its string representation, using a series of conditional checks to map numeric values to their character equivalents. This ensures precise handling of different base conversions within the specified range.

--- RESPONSE ---
<thinking>
Let me analyze this Python function:

The function `change_base` converts a number `x` from base 10 to the specified `base`, returning a string representation. The algorithm:
1. If x is 0, return "0"
2. Otherwise, repeatedly take x % base to get digits, and divide x by base
3. The digits are collected in reverse order (least significant first), so they need to be reversed
4. Convert digits to strings and join them

For Dafny translation:
- Input types: x: int, base: int
- Return type: string
- Preconditions: x >= 0 (non-negative), 2 <= base < 10 (valid base range)
- The main loop terminates because x decreases in each iteration (x //= base) and x >= 0

I'll need to handle string conversion for digits 0-9 and manage the reversal of digits properly.

    requires 2 <= base < 10
    ensures |result| >= 1

    if x == 0 {
        return "0";
    }
    
    var digits: seq<string> := [];
    var temp_x := x;
    
    while temp_x > 0
        invariant temp_x >= 0
        decreases temp_x
    {
        var digit := temp_x % base;
        var digit_char := if digit == 0 then "0"
                         else if digit == 1 then "1"
                         else if digit == 2 then "2"
                         else if digit == 3 then "3"

                         else if digit == 8 then "8"
                         else "9";
        digits := [digit_char] + digits;  // prepend to get correct order
        temp_x := temp_x / base;
    }
    
    // Join the digits
    result := "";
    var i := 0;
    while i < |digits|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |digits|
        decreases |digits| - i
    {
        result := result + digits[i];
        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```
