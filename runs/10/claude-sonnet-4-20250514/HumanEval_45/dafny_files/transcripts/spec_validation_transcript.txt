=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """
    return (a * h) / 2
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
method triangle_area(a: real, h: real) returns (area: real)
  requires a >= 0.0
  requires h >= 0.0
  ensures area >= 0.0
  ensures area == (a * h) / 2.0
{
    area := (a * h) / 2.0;
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function and the Dafny specifications:

**Python Function Analysis:**
- The function takes two parameters: `a` (length of a side) and `h` (height)
- It returns the area of a triangle using the formula: (a * h) / 2
- The docstring example shows triangle_area(5, 3) = 7.5, which is correct: (5 * 3) / 2 = 7.5
- There are no explicit preconditions in the Python code about the values of `a` and `h`

**Dafny Specifications Analysis:**
1. **Requires clauses:**
   - `requires a >= 0.0` - This makes sense for a side length
   - `requires h >= 0.0` - This makes sense for a height
   
2. **Ensures clauses:**
   - `ensures area >= 0.0` - This follows from the requires clauses and the formula
   - `ensures area == (a * h) / 2.0` - This correctly captures the mathematical formula

**Evaluation:**
The Dafny specifications seem to properly capture the behavior of the Python function:

1. The preconditions (a >= 0.0, h >= 0.0) are reasonable for geometric measurements, even though the Python function doesn't explicitly check these
2. The postcondition correctly specifies the formula used
3. The area >= 0.0 postcondition follows logically from the preconditions and formula

The specifications are mathematically sound and capture the intended behavior of computing triangle area. While the Python function doesn't explicitly validate inputs, the Dafny preconditions are appropriate for the geometric context.

The specifications fully describe what the function does: given non-negative side length and height, return the triangle area using the standard formula.

--- RESPONSE ---
THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS

```dafny
method triangle_area(a: real, h: real) returns (area: real)
  requires a >= 0.0
  requires h >= 0.0
  ensures area >= 0.0
  ensures area == (a * h) / 2.0
{
    area := (a * h) / 2.0;
}
```
