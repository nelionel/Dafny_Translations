You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.

I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `fib4`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the provided Python function step by step.

The function computes the nth element of the fib4 sequence, which is defined as:
- fib4(0) = 0
- fib4(1) = 0  
- fib4(2) = 2
- fib4(3) = 0
- fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4) for n >= 4

The Python implementation uses an iterative approach with a sliding window of 4 values.

For the Dafny translation:
1. Input type: `n: int` - straightforward mapping
2. Return type: `int` - straightforward mapping  
3. Preconditions: `n >= 0` (since we're computing the nth element of a sequence)
4. Postconditions: The result should match the mathematical definition of fib4

For the loop invariant, I need to think about what remains true throughout the loop:
- The variables a, b, c, d represent fib4(i-4), fib4(i-3), fib4(i-2), fib4(i-1) where i is the current loop iteration
- The loop runs from i = 4 to n
- At each iteration, we compute fib4(i) and update the sliding window

Let me think about the termination: The loop runs from 4 to n, so it decreases by (n + 1 - i).

Let me write the Dafny code:

```dafny
method fib4(n: int) returns (result: int)
  requires n >= 0
  ensures result == fib4_recursive(n)
{
  if n == 0 {
    return 0;
  } else if n == 1 {
    return 0;
  } else if n == 2 {
    return 2;
  } else if n == 3 {
    return 0;
  }
  
  var a, b, c, d := 0, 0, 2, 0;  // fib4(0), fib4(1), fib4(2), fib4(3)
  var i := 4;
  
  while i <= n
    invariant 4 <= i <= n + 1
    invariant a == fib4_recursive(i-4)
    invariant b == fib4_recursive(i-

I'll complete the partial invariant by copying the next thinking:
3)
    invariant c == fib4_recursive(i-2)
    invariant d == fib4_recursive(i-1)
    decreases n + 1 - i
  {
    var next := a + b + c + d;
    a, b, c, d := b, c, d, next;
    i := i + 1;
  }
  
  return d;
}
```

I'll summarize the key observations:
- The method handles base cases for n = 0, 1, 2, 3 explicitly
- Uses a sliding window approach to compute fib4(n)
- Maintains loop invariants tracking the previous four sequence values
- Computes the next value by summing the previous four values

--- RESPONSE ---
<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Types**: The function takes an `int` parameter `n` and returns an `int`.

2. **Logic**: The fib4 sequence is defined as:
   - fib4(0) = 0
   - fib4(1) = 0  
   - fib4(2) = 2
   - fib4(3) = 0
   - fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4) for n >= 4

3. **Implementation**: Uses an iterative approach with a sliding window of 4 values (a, b, c, d) representing the last 4 computed values.

4. **Preconditions**: The function should work for non-negative integers (n >= 0).

5. **Postconditions**: The result should match the mathematical definition of the fib4 sequence.

6. **Loop analysis**: The main loop runs from i = 4 to n, maintaining the invariant that a, b, c, d represent fib4(i-4), fib4(i-3), fib4(i-2), fib4(i-1) respectively.

7. **Termination**: The loop decreases by (n + 1 - i).

I'll need to define a recursive function for the mathematical specification and use it in the postcondition.
