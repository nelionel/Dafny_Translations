=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def fib4(n: int):
    """The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence.  Do not use recursion.
    >>> fib4(5)
    4
    >>> fib4(6)
    8
    >>> fib4(7)
    14
    """
    # Base cases
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    
    # For n >= 4, use iterative approach
    # Keep track of the last 4 values
    a, b, c, d = 0, 0, 2, 0  # fib4(0), fib4(1), fib4(2), fib4(3)
    
    # Compute fib4(4) through fib4(n)
    for i in range(4, n + 1):
        next_val = a + b + c + d
        # Shift the window: move everything one position left
        a, b, c, d = b, c, d, next_val
    
    return d
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
method fib4(n: int) returns (result: int)
  requires n >= 0
  ensures result == fib4_spec(n)
{
  if n == 0 {
    return 0;
  } else if n == 1 {
    return 0;
  } else if n == 2 {
    return 2;
  } else if n == 3 {
    return 0;
  }
  
  var a, b, c, d := 0, 0, 2, 0;  // fib4(0), fib4(1), fib4(2), fib4(3)
  var i := 4;
  
  while i <= n
    invariant 4 <= i <= n + 1
    invariant a == fib4_spec(i-4)
    invariant b == fib4_spec(i-3)
    invariant c == fib4_spec(i-2)
    invariant d == fib4_spec(i-1)
    decreases n + 1 - i
  {
    var next_val := a + b + c + d;
    a, b, c, d := b, c, d, next_val;
    i := i + 1;
  }
  
  return d;
}

function fib4_spec(n: int): int
  requires n >= 0
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 then 0
  else if n == 1 then 0
  else if n == 2 then 2
  else if n == 3 then 0
  else fib4_spec(n-1) + fib4_spec(n-2) + fib4_spec(n-3) + fib4_spec(n-4)
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function and the Dafny code to see if the specifications properly describe the behavior.

**Python function analysis:**
1. The function takes an integer `n` as input
2. It returns an integer
3. The base cases are:
   - fib4(0) = 0
   - fib4(1) = 0
   - fib4(2) = 2
   - fib4(3) = 0
4. For n >= 4: fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)
5. The function uses an iterative approach to avoid recursion
6. The function doesn't explicitly handle negative inputs, but from the context it seems to expect non-negative inputs

**Dafny code analysis:**
1. The method has `requires n >= 0` - this captures the precondition that n should be non-negative
2. The method has `ensures result == fib4_spec(n)` - this says the result equals the specification function
3. The `fib4_spec` function defines the recursive relationship correctly:
   - fib4_spec(0) = 0
   - fib4_spec(1) = 0  
   - fib4_spec(2) = 2
   - fib4_spec(3) = 0
   - fib4_spec(n) = fib4_spec(n-1) + fib4_spec(n-2) + fib4_spec(n-3) + fib4_spec(n-4) for n >= 4

Let me check if this captures the full behavior:

1. **Preconditions**: The `requires n >= 0` seems appropriate since the function is defined for non-negative integers according to the mathematical definition.

2. **Postconditions**: The `ensures result == fib4_spec(n)` captures that the result should match the mathematical definition of the fib4 sequence.
 
The specification function precisely encapsulates the mathematical definition. The loop invariants provide a robust mechanism to track the sliding window of previous fib4 values, ensuring the computation maintains the correct sequence progression. Each variable in the loop represents a specific previous term, allowing the iterative calculation to accurately compute the desired fib4 value.

The precondition and postcondition work together to validate the function's domain and guarantee the result's correctness. By carefully defining the specification, the implementation ensures a precise and mathematically sound approach to calculating the fib4 sequence.
