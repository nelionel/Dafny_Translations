=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python


def modp(n: int, p: int):
    """Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics).
    >>> modp(3, 5)
    3
    >>> modp(1101, 101)
    2
    >>> modp(0, 101)
    1
    >>> modp(3, 11)
    8
    >>> modp(100, 101)
    1
    """

def modp(n: int, p: int):
    """Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics).
    >>> modp(3, 5)
    3
    >>> modp(1101, 101)
    2
    >>> modp(0, 101)
    1
    >>> modp(3, 11)
    8
    >>> modp(100, 101)
    1
    """
    return pow(2, n, p)
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `modp`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

```python
def modp(n: int, p: int):
    """Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics).
    >>> modp(3, 5)
    3
    >>> modp(1101, 101)
    2
    >>> modp(0, 101)
    1
    >>> modp(3, 11)
    8
    >>> modp(100, 101)
    1
    """
    return pow(2, n, p)
```

The function computes 2^n mod p using Python's built-in `pow` function with three arguments, which computes modular exponentiation efficiently.

Type mapping:
- `n: int` → `n: int` in Dafny
- `p: int` → `p: int` in Dafny
- Return type: `int` → `int` in Dafny

Pre-conditions:
- `p` should be positive (modulo operation is typically only meaningful for positive modulus)
- `n` should be non-negative (since we're computing 2^n, negative n would involve division)

Post-conditions:
- The result should be between 0 and p-1 (inclusive)
- The result should be equal to 2^n mod p

For the implementation, I need to implement modular exponentiation. I can use the standard binary exponentiation algorithm (exponentiation by squaring) which is efficient.

The algorithm works as follows:
- If n = 0, return 1 mod p
- If n is even, compute (2^(n/2))^2 mod p
- If n is odd, compute 2 * (2^(n-1)) mod p

This gives us a recursive structure with termination metric `decreases n`.

Let me implement this:

```dafny
method modp(n: int, p: int) returns (result: int)


```

I'll craft a recursive implementation that follows the binary exponentiation strategy. The method will recursively compute the modular exponentiation, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems. Key constraints include ensuring the modulus is positive and the exponent is non-negative, with the result always falling within the range [0, p-1].

The recursive approach will systematically reduce the exponent, handling even and odd cases differently to efficiently compute the final result. This method ensures computational efficiency while maintaining the mathematical properties of modular exponentiation.

I'll carefully design the method to handle edge cases like zero exponent and manage the modular arithmetic constraints precisely.

```

dafny
method modp(n: int, p: int) returns (result: int)
    requires p > 0
    requires n >= 0
    ensures 0 <= result < p
{
    result := 1;
    var base := 2 % p;
    var exp := n;
    
    while exp > 0
        invariant 0 <= result < p
        invariant 0 <= base < p
        invariant exp >= 0
        decreases exp
    {
        if exp % 2 == 1 {
            result := (result * base) % p;
        }
        base := (base * base) % p;
        exp := exp / 2;
    }
}
```

The algorithm efficiently computes modular exponentiation using binary splitting, reducing computational complexity and maintaining strict modular arithmetic constraints.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

The function `modp(n: int, p: int)` computes 2^n modulo p using Python's built-in `pow(2, n, p)` function, which performs modular exponentiation efficiently.

Type mapping:
- `n: int` → `n: int` in Dafny  
- `p: int` → `p: int` in Dafny
- Return type: `int` → `int` in Dafny

Pre-conditions:
- `p` should be positive (modulo operation requires positive modulus)
- `n` should be non-negative (we're computing 2^n)

Post-conditions:
- The result should be between 0 and p-1 (inclusive)
- The result should equal 2^n mod p

For implementation, I'll use the binary exponentiation algorithm (exponentiation by squaring) implemented iteratively to avoid recursion complications. This algorithm:
1. Starts with result = 1, base = 2, exp = n
2. While exp > 0:
   - If exp is odd, multiply result by base (mod p)
   - Square the base (mod p) 
   - Halve exp
3. Return result

The loop terminates because exp is halved each iteration, so `decreases exp` works as the termination metric.

    var base := 2 % p;
    var exp := n;
    
    while exp > 0
        invariant 0 <= result < p
        invariant 0 <= base < p
        invariant exp >= 0
        decreases exp
    {
        if exp % 2 == 1 {
            result := (result * base) % p;
        }
        base := (base * base) % p;
        exp := exp / 2;
