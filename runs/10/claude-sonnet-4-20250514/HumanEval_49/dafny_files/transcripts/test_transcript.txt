=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `modp`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python


METADATA = {}


def check(candidate):
    assert candidate(3, 5) == 3
    assert candidate(1101, 101) == 2
    assert candidate(0, 101) == 1
    assert candidate(3, 11) == 8
    assert candidate(100, 101) == 1
    assert candidate(30, 5) == 4
    assert candidate(31, 5) == 3


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method modp(n: int, p: int) returns (result: int)
    requires p > 0
    requires n >= 0
    ensures 0 <= result < p
{
    result := 1;
    var base := 2 % p;
    var exp := n;
    
    while exp > 0
        invariant 0 <= result < p
        invariant 0 <= base < p
        invariant exp >= 0
        decreases exp
    {
        if exp % 2 == 1 {
            result := (result * base) % p;
        }
        base := (base * base) % p;
        exp := exp / 2;
    }
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`modp`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `modp` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `modp` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python test code and the Dafny solution:

1. The Python tests are calling `candidate(...)` which corresponds to the `modp` method in Dafny.
2. The Dafny method signature is: `method modp(n: int, p: int) returns (result: int)`
3. The tests are:
   - `candidate(3, 5) == 3`
   - `candidate(1101, 101) == 2`
   - `candidate(0, 101) == 1`
   - `candidate(3, 11) == 8`
   - `candidate(100, 101) == 1`
   - `candidate(30, 5) == 4`
   - `candidate(31, 5) == 3`

Now I need to:
1. Create a dummy implementation that has the same signature and returns a default value
2. Translate each test into a Dafny test method

For the dummy implementation:
- The method signature is `method modp(n: int, p: int) returns (result: int)`
- It should return a default value, which for int is 0
- I need to make sure it satisfies the requires/ensures clauses if they exist. Looking at the solution, there are requires clauses: `requires p > 0` and `requires n >= 0`, and ensures: `ensures 0 <= result < p`

For the dummy, I need to return a value that satisfies `0 <= result < p`. Since `p > 0`, I can just return 0 which will satisfy this.

Wait, let me double-check the ensures clause. It says `ensures 0 <= result < p`. Since `p > 0` is required, returning 0 should work as `0 <= 0 < p` when `p > 0`.

For the tests:
- Each test should call `modp` with the given parameters


- I'll capture the method's output in a local variable
- Use Dafny's `expect` statement to verify the result matches the expected value

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the Python tests and the Dafny solution:

1. **Method Analysis**: The Dafny method is `modp(n: int, p: int) returns (result: int)` with preconditions and postconditions.

2. **Test Translation**: Each Python `assert candidate(x, y) == z` becomes a Dafny test method calling `modp(x, y)` and expecting result `z`.

<dummy>
method modp(n: int, p: int) returns (result: int)
    requires p > 0
    requires n >= 0
    ensures 0 <= result < p
{
    result := 0;
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := modp(3, 5);
    expect result == 3;
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := modp(1101, 101);
    expect result == 2;
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := modp(0, 101);
    expect result == 1;
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := modp(3, 11);
    expect result == 8;
}

method {:test} test_4()
{
    var result := modp(100, 101);
    expect result == 1;
}

method {:test} test_5()
{
    var result := modp(30, 5);
    expect result == 4;
}

method {:test} test_6()
{
    var result := modp(31, 5);
    expect result == 3;
}
```
