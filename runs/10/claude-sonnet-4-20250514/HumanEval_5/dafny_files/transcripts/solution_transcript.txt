=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python
from typing import List


def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'
    >>> intersperse([], 4)
    []
    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
    """

from typing import List


def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'
    >>> intersperse([], 4)
    []
    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
    """
    if not numbers:
        return []
    
    result = []
    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
        result.append(num)
        # Add delimiter after each element except the last one
        if i < len(numbers) - 1:
            result.append(delimeter)
    
    return result
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `intersperse`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Types Analysis:**
   - Input: `numbers: List[int]` → Dafny: `seq<int>`
   - Input: `delimeter: int` → Dafny: `int`
   - Output: `List[int]` → Dafny: `seq<int>`

2. **Function Logic:**
   - If the input list is empty, return an empty list
   - Otherwise, iterate through the input list
   - For each element, add it to the result
   - If it's not the last element, also add the delimiter
   - Return the result

3. **Pre-conditions:**
   - There don't seem to be any special preconditions needed

4. **Post-conditions:**
   - If input is empty, result is empty
   - If input has one element, result has one element (same as input)
   - If input has n elements (n > 1), result has 2*n-1 elements
   - The elements at even indices in the result should be from the original sequence
   - The elements at odd indices in the result should be the delimiter

5. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates through the input sequence
   - Loop invariant: result contains the properly interspersed elements processed so far
   - Termination: the loop variable i increases and is bounded by the length of numbers

Let me write the Dafny implementation:

```dafny
method intersperse(numbers: seq<int>, delimeter: int) returns (result: seq<int>)
  ensures |numbers| == 0 ==> |result| == 0
  ensures |numbers| == 1 ==> result == numbers
  ensures |numbers| > 1 ==> |result| == 2 * |numbers| - 1
  ensures |numbers| > 1 ==> forall i :: 0 <= i < |numbers| ==> result[2*i] == numbers[i]
  ensures |numbers| > 1 ==> forall i :: 0 <= i < |numbers| - 1 ==> result[2*i + 1] == delimeter
{
  if |numbers| == 0 {
    return [];
  }
  
  result := [];
  var i := 0;
  while i < |numbers|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant i == 0 ==> |result| == 0
    invariant i > 0 ==> |result| == 2 * i - 1
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j

I'll complete the partial thought by copying over the next thinking:

    < j < i ==> result[2*j] == numbers[j]
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> result[2*j + 1] == delimeter
  {
    result := result + [numbers[i]];
    if i < |numbers| - 1 {
      result := result + [delimeter];
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  return result;
}
```

The implementation carefully builds the result sequence by inserting elements from the input list and interspersing the delimiter between them. The method handles edge cases like empty lists and single-element lists, ensuring the correct output sequence is generated.

The loop invariants track the progression of the result array, maintaining its structure and ensuring each element is placed correctly. The approach systematically constructs the final sequence by alternating between input numbers and delimiters.

4. **Post-conditions:**
   - If input is empty, result is empty
   - If input has one element, result equals input
   - If input has n > 1 elements, result has 2*n-1 elements
   - Original elements appear at even indices, delimiters at odd indices

5. **Loop Analysis:**
   - Loop iterates through indices 0 to |numbers|-1
   - Invariant: result contains properly processed elements up to current index
   - Termination: index increases and is bounded by sequence length
