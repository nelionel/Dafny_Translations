=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python


def encode_shift(s: str):
    """
    returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])


def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    """

def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `decode_shift`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python functions:

1. `encode_shift(s: str)`:
   - Takes a string `s`
   - Returns a string where each character is shifted by 5 positions forward in the alphabet
   - Uses modular arithmetic to wrap around (a+5 = f, z+5 = e)

2. `decode_shift(s: str)`:
   - Takes a string `s` that was encoded with `encode_shift`
   - Returns the decoded string by shifting each character back by 5 positions
   - Uses modular arithmetic to wrap around

The logic:
- For encoding: `chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a"))`
- For decoding: `chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a"))`

Key observations:
1. Both functions assume the input contains only lowercase letters 'a' to 'z'
2. The shift is always 5 positions
3. The functions use modular arithmetic to handle wraparound

For Dafny:
- Input type: `string`
- Return type: `string` 
- Need to handle character arithmetic
- Need to ensure the modular arithmetic works correctly
- Since we're dealing with strings, we need to process character by character

Preconditions:
- The input string should contain only lowercase letters 'a' to 'z'

Postconditions:
- The output string has the same length as input
- Each character in output is a lowercase letter

For the implementation, I'll need to:
1. Convert the string to a sequence of characters
2. Process each character with the shift operation
3. Convert back to string

In Dafny, I can work with strings directly and use character arithmetic.

Let me implement the `decode_shift` function:

--- RESPONSE ---
<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python code:

1. **Function Analysis:**
   - `decode_shift(s: str)` takes a string and returns a string
   - It decodes a string that was previously encoded with a 5-character shift
   - The logic shifts each character back by 5 positions in the alphabet using modular arithmetic
   - Formula: `chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a"))`

2. **Type Mapping:**
   - Python `str` maps to Dafny `string`
   - The function processes individual characters

3. **Preconditions:**
   - The input string should contain only lowercase letters 'a' to 'z'
   - This is implied by the algorithm since it assumes alphabet positioning from 'a'

4. **Postconditions:**
   - Output string has same length as input
   - Each character in output is a lowercase letter 'a' to 'z'
   - The function is the inverse of `encode_shift`

5. **Implementation Strategy:**
   - Process each character in the string
   - Apply the reverse shift formula
   - Handle modular arithmetic for wraparound (e.g., 'a' - 5 should wrap to 'v')

6. **No loops needed** - I can work with string indexing or use sequence operations

```dafny
method decode_shift(s: string) returns (result: string)
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> 'a' <= s[i] <= 'z'
  ensures |result| == |s|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> 'a' <= result[i] <= 'z'
{
  result := "";
  var i := 0;
  
  while i < |s|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
    invariant |result| == i
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < |result| ==> 'a' <= result[j] <= 'z'
  {
    var ch := s[i];
    var pos := (ch as int) - ('a' as int);
    var shifted_pos := (pos - 5 + 26) % 26;
    var decoded_char := (shifted_pos + ('a' as int)) as char;
    result := result + [decoded_char];
    i := i + 1;
  }
}
