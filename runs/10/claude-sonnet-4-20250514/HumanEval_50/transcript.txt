======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def encode_shift(s: str):
    """
    returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])


def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at the `encode_shift` function, I can see it shifts each character forward by 5 positions in the alphabet. To decode it, I need to shift each character backward by 5 positions.

```python
def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])
```

The key difference is changing `+ 5` to `- 5` in the formula. The modulo operation `% 26` ensures that if we go below 'a' (when subtracting 5), we wrap around to the end of the alphabet correctly.

For example:
- If we have 'f' (encoded), it becomes 'a' (decoded): f → a
- If we have 'c' (encoded), it becomes 'x' (decoded): c → x (wraps around)
