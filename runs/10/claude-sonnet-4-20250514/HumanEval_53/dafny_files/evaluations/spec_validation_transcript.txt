=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
method add(x: int, y: int) returns (result: int)
    ensures result == x + y
{
    result := x + y;
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function and the Dafny specifications:

**Python Function:**
```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y
```

The Python function:
1. Takes two integers x and y
2. Returns their sum (x + y)
3. The docstring shows examples: add(2, 3) = 5 and add(5, 7) = 12
4. There are no special conditions or constraints mentioned
5. It's a simple addition operation

**Dafny Code:**
```dafny
method add(x: int, y: int) returns (result: int)
    ensures result == x + y
{
    result := x + y;
}
```

The Dafny specifications:
1. Takes two integers x and y as parameters
2. Returns an integer result
3. Has one ensures clause: `result == x + y`
4. No requires clauses

Now let me check if the specifications are adequate:

1. **Preconditions (requires)**: The Python function doesn't have any explicit preconditions. It works for any two integers. In Dafny, integers can be arbitrary large (unlike machine integers), so there's no overflow concern. No requires clause is needed.

2. **Postconditions (ensures)**: The Python function returns `x + y`. The Dafny ensures clause states `result == x + y`. This perfectly captures the behavior.

3. **Complete behavior**: The function does exactly one thing - adds two numbers and returns the result. The ensures clause captures this completely.

4. **Edge cases**: There are no special edge cases in the Python function. It's straightforward addition.

The Dafny specification appears to be complete and accurate. It correctly states that the result will be equal to x + y, which is exactly what the Python function does. There are no missing preconditions or postconditions.

--- RESPONSE ---
THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS

```dafny
method add(x: int, y: int) returns (result: int)
    ensures result == x + y
{
    result := x + y;
}
```
