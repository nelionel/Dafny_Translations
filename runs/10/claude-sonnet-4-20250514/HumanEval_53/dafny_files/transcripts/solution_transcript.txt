=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python


def add(x: int, y: int):
    """Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """

def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `add`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Looking at the Python function, it's a simple addition function that takes two integers and returns their sum. The function signature is:

```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x + y
```

Let me analyze this:

1. **Types**: The function takes two integers `x` and `y` and returns an integer. In Dafny, these would be `int` types.

2. **Logic**: The function simply returns `x + y`. This is a straightforward arithmetic operation.

3. **Pre-conditions**: There are no explicit pre-conditions mentioned in the Python code. Since we're dealing with integer addition, there shouldn't be any constraints on the input values.

4. **Post-conditions**: The post-condition should be that the result equals the sum of the two input parameters.

5. **Loops/Recursion**: There are no loops or recursive calls in this function.

6. **Termination**: Since there are no loops or recursion, termination is not a concern.

The Dafny translation should be straightforward:

```dafny
method add(x: int, y: int) returns (result: int)
    ensures result == x + y
{
    result := x + y;
}
```

Let me double-check:
- The method name is `add` (same as Python)
- It takes two `int` parameters `x` and `y`
- It returns an `int` called `result`
- The ensures clause guarantees that the result equals x + y
- The implementation simply assigns x + y to result
- No requires clause is needed since there are no preconditions
- No decreases clause is needed since there's no recursion or loops

Looking at the Python function, it's a simple addition function that takes two integers and returns their sum. Let me analyze:

1. **Types**: The function takes two integers `x` and `y` and returns an integer. In Dafny, these map directly to `int` types.

2. **Logic**: The function simply returns `x + y`. This is a straightforward arithmetic operation with no complex logic.

3. **Pre-conditions**: There are no constraints on the input values since integer addition in both Python and Dafny can handle any integer values without overflow concerns in the mathematical sense.

4. **Post-conditions**: The result should equal the sum of the two input parameters: `result == x + y`.

5. **Loops/Recursion**: There are no loops or recursive calls, so no invariants or termination measures are needed.

This is a very straightforward translation with no edge cases to handle.

```dafny
method add(x: int, y: int) returns (result: int)
    ensures result == x + y
{
    result := x + y;
}
