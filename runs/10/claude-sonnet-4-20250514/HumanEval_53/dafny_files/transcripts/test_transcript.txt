=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `add`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python


METADATA = {}


def check(candidate):
    import random

    assert candidate(0, 1) == 1
    assert candidate(1, 0) == 1
    assert candidate(2, 3) == 5
    assert candidate(5, 7) == 12
    assert candidate(7, 5) == 12

    for i in range(100):
        x, y = random.randint(0, 1000), random.randint(0, 1000)
        assert candidate(x, y) == x + y


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method add(x: int, y: int) returns (result: int)
    ensures result == x + y
{
    result := x + y;
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`add`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `add` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `add` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze this step by step:

1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - The Dafny method is named `add`
   - It has signature: `method add(x: int, y: int) returns (result: int)`
   - It ensures `result == x + y`

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation:**
   - I need to create a dummy version with the same signature
   - Since it's a method that returns an int, I should return 0 as default

3. **Translate the tests:**
   - The Python tests have these assertions:
     - `candidate(0, 1) == 1`
     - `candidate(1, 0) == 1`
     - `candidate(2, 3) == 5`
     - `candidate(5, 7) == 12`
     - `candidate(7, 5) == 12`
   - There's also a loop with random tests, but I should just translate the explicit assertions since the loop tests the same property (x + y)

Let me create the dummy and tests:

--- RESPONSE ---
<dummy>
method add(x: int, y: int) returns (result: int)
{
    result := 0;
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(0, 1);
    expect result == 1;
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := add(1, 0);
    expect result == 1;
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := add(5, 7);
    expect result == 12;
}

method {:test} test_4()
{
    var result := add(7, 5);
    expect result == 12;
}
```
