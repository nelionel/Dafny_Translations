=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str):
    """
    Check if two words have the same characters.
    >>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc')
    True
    >>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc')
    True
    >>> same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd')
    True
    >>> same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc')
    False
    >>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce')
    False
    >>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc')
    False
    """
    return set(s0) == set(s1)
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
method same_chars(s0: string, s1: string) returns (result: bool)
    ensures result <==> (set c | c in s0) == (set c | c in s1)
{
    var set0 := set c | c in s0;
    var set1 := set c | c in s1;
    result := set0 == set1;
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function and the Dafny code.

**Python Function Analysis:**
The Python function `same_chars(s0, s1)` takes two strings and returns `True` if they have the same set of characters (ignoring duplicates and order), `False` otherwise. It does this by converting each string to a set and comparing the sets.

From the examples:
- `same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc')` returns `True` because both have chars {e,a,b,c,d,z}
- `same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc')` returns `True` because both have chars {a,b,c,d}
- `same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd')` returns `True` because both have chars {a,b,c,d}
- `same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc')` returns `False` because first has {e,a,b,c,d} but second has {a,b,c,d}
- `same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce')` returns `False` because first has {a,b,c,d} but second has {a,b,c,d,e}
- `same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc')` returns `False` because first has {e,a,b,c,d,z} but second has {a,b,c,d}

**Dafny Code Analysis:**
```dafny
method same_chars(s0: string, s1: string) returns (result: bool)
    ensures result <==> (set c | c in s0) == (set c | c in s1)
```

The Dafny specification says that the result is true if and only if the set of characters in s0 equals the set of characters in s1. This matches exactly what the Python function does.
 
I'll examine the input constraints and specification details. Both the Python function and Dafny method handle inputs flexibly, with no restrictions on string content or length. The postcondition precisely defines the character set comparison, ensuring the method returns true only when both strings contain exactly the same unique characters.

The specification captures the core logic: comparing character sets regardless of order or frequency. This approach allows for robust string comparison across various input scenarios, from empty strings to strings with repeated or unique characters.

The implementation demonstrates a direct translation of the set comparison logic, creating character sets and performing a direct equality check, which maintains the intended semantic equivalence between the Python and Dafny approaches.

--- RESPONSE ---
THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS

```dafny
method same_chars(s0: string, s1: string) returns (result: bool)
    ensures result <==> (set c | c in s0) == (set c | c in s1)
{
    var set0 := set c | c in s0;
    var set1 := set c | c in s1;
    result := set0 == set1;
}
```
