=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `fib`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python


METADATA = {}


def check(candidate):
    assert candidate(10) == 55
    assert candidate(1) == 1
    assert candidate(8) == 21
    assert candidate(11) == 89
    assert candidate(12) == 144


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
function fibSpec(n: int): int
  requires n > 0
  decreases n
{
  if n == 1 || n == 2 then 1
  else fibSpec(n-1) + fibSpec(n-2)
}

method fib(n: int) returns (result: int)
  requires n > 0
  ensures result == fibSpec(n)
{
  if n == 1 || n == 2 {
    return 1;
  }
  
  var a := 1;
  var b := 1;
  var i := 3;
  
  while i <= n
    invariant 3 <= i <= n + 1
    invariant a == fibSpec(i-2)
    invariant b == fibSpec(i-1)
  {
    var temp := a + b;
    a := b;
    b := temp;
    i := i + 1;
  }
  
  return b;
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`fib`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `fib` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `fib` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the provided code:

1. **The method to test**: `fib` - this is a Dafny method that takes an int and returns an int
2. **Method signature from the solution**: `method fib(n: int) returns (result: int)`
3. **Python tests**: 
   - `assert candidate(10) == 55`
   - `assert candidate(1) == 1`  
   - `assert candidate(8) == 21`
   - `assert candidate(11) == 89`
   - `assert candidate(12) == 144`

So I need to:
1. Create a dummy implementation of `fib` that has the same signature and returns a default int value (0)
2. Translate each assert into a test method that calls `fib` and uses `expect` to check the result

Let me create the dummy first:
```dafny
method fib(n: int) returns (result: int)
{
    result := 0;
}
```

Wait, I need to be careful about the requires clause. The original has `requires n > 0`, so my dummy should have the same precondition to match the signature properly.

Actually, let me look at the signature again. The original is:
```dafny
method fib(n: int) returns (result: int)
  requires n > 0
  ensures result == fibSpec(n)
```

For the dummy, I don't need the ensures clause but I should include the requires clause to match the method signature properly. But actually, for a dummy, I want to keep it as minimal as possible while still being compilable. Let me just match the basic signature.

```dafny
method fib(n: int) returns (result: int)
{
    result := 0;
}
```

Now for the tests:
1. `candidate(10) == 55` becomes `test_0` calling `fib(10)` and expecting 55


2. `candidate(1) == 1` becomes `test_1` calling `fib(1)` and expecting 1
3. `candidate(8) == 21` becomes `test_2` calling `fib(8)` and expecting 21
4. `candidate(11) == 89` becomes `test_3` calling `fib(11)` and expecting 89
5. `candidate(12) == 144` becomes `test_4` calling `fib(12)` and expecting 144

I'll create test methods for each of these assertions to verify the Fibonacci implementation. Each test will use Dafny's `expect` to validate the results against the expected Fibonacci sequence values.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the provided code:

1. **Method to test**: `fib` - a Dafny method that takes an int parameter and returns an int result
2. **Method signature**: `method fib(n: int) returns (result: int)`
3. **Python tests**: Testing fibonacci numbers at various positions

<dummy>
method fib(n: int) returns (result: int)
{
    result := 0;
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := fib(10);
    expect result == 55;
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := fib(1);
    expect result == 1;
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := fib(8);
    expect result == 21;
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := fib(11);
    expect result == 89;
}

method {:test} test_4()
{
    var result := fib(12);
    expect result == 144;
}
```
