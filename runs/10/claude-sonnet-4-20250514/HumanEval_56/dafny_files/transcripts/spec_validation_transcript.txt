=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """ brackets is a string of "<" and ">".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("<")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("<>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
    False
    """
    counter = 0
    
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "<":
            counter += 1
        elif bracket == ">":
            counter -= 1
            # If counter goes negative, we have more closing than opening brackets
            if counter < 0:
                return False
    
    # All brackets are matched if counter is zero
    return counter == 0
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
method correct_bracketing(brackets: string) returns (result: bool)
    ensures result == (forall i :: 0 <= i <= |brackets| ==> 
        |set j | 0 <= j < i && brackets[j] == '<'| >= |set j | 0 <= j < i && brackets[j] == '>'|) &&
        |set j | 0 <= j < |brackets| && brackets[j] == '<'| == |set j | 0 <= j < |brackets| && brackets[j] == '>'|
{
    var counter := 0;
    var i := 0;
    
    while i < |brackets|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |brackets|
        invariant counter >= 0
        invariant counter == |set j | 0 <= j < i && brackets[j] == '<'| - |set j | 0 <= j < i && brackets[j] == '>'|
        decreases |brackets| - i
    {
        if brackets[i] == '<' {
            counter := counter + 1;
        } else if brackets[i] == '>' {
            counter := counter - 1;
            if counter < 0 {
                return false;
            }
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    
    return counter == 0;
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me carefully analyze the Python function and the Dafny specifications.

**Python Function Behavior:**
1. It takes a string containing only '<' and '>' characters
2. It returns True if every opening bracket '<' has a corresponding closing bracket '>'
3. The key insight is that at any point during the scan, the number of opening brackets seen so far must be >= the number of closing brackets seen so far (counter >= 0)
4. At the end, the total number of opening brackets must equal the total number of closing brackets (counter == 0)

**Current Dafny Specifications Analysis:**

The ensures clause says:
```dafny
result == (forall i :: 0 <= i <= |brackets| ==> 
    |set j | 0 <= j < i && brackets[j] == '<'| >= |set j | 0 <= j < i && brackets[j] == '>'|) &&
    |set j | 0 <= j < |brackets| && brackets[j] == '<'| == |set j | 0 <= j < |brackets| && brackets[j] == '>'|
```

Let me break this down:
1. `forall i :: 0 <= i <= |brackets| ==> |set j | 0 <= j < i && brackets[j] == '<'| >= |set j | 0 <= j < i && brackets[j] == '>'|`
   - This says: for every prefix position i, the number of '<' in the prefix is >= the number of '>' in the prefix
   - This captures the "never go negative" requirement correctly

2. `|set j | 0 <= j < |brackets| && brackets[j] == '<'| == |set j | 0 <= j < |brackets| && brackets[j] == '>'|`
   - This says: the total number of '<' equals the total number of '>'
   - This captures the "balanced at the end" requirement correctly
   
I notice the implementation handles input validation implicitly. The code only processes '<' and '>' characters, effectively filtering out any unexpected input. This means a formal precondition might not be strictly necessary. The implementation gracefully handles unexpected characters by simply ignoring them, which suggests a robust approach to input validation.

The method's design allows for flexibility while maintaining the core bracket-matching logic. By checking and adjusting the counter only for specific characters, it creates a natural input validation mechanism without explicitly rejecting non-bracket characters.

However, the Python docstring explicitly defines the expected input as a string containing only '<' and '>' characters. This suggests we should align the Dafny specification with this explicit contract, potentially adding a requires clause to enforce the input constraint.

The postcondition logic precisely captures the bracket matching requirements: preventing negative counter values during scanning and ensuring equal bracket counts at the end. The ensures clause's structure perfectly reflects the two-part condition, matching the implementation's intent.

The key improvement would be introducing a precondition that restricts the input to valid bracket characters, ensuring the function's correctness and alignment with the original Python implementation.

=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function's behavior and the current Dafny specifications:

**Python Function Behavior:**
1. Takes a string of '<' and '>' characters
2. Uses a counter to track opening vs closing brackets
3. For each '<', increments counter
4. For each '>', decrements counter
5. If counter ever goes negative during processing, returns False immediately
6. At the end, returns True if counter is 0, False otherwise

**Current Dafny Specifications Analysis:**

**requires clause:**
```dafny
requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |brackets| ==> brackets[i] == '<' || brackets[i] == '>'
```
This correctly captures that the string should only contain '<' and '>' characters.

**ensures clause:**
```dafny
ensures result == (forall i :: 0 <= i <= |brackets| ==> 
    |set j | 0 <= j < i && brackets[j] == '<'| >= |set j | 0 <= j < i && brackets[j] == '>'|) &&
    |set j | 0 <= j < |brackets| && brackets[j] == '<'| == |set j | 0 <= j < |brackets| && brackets[j] == '>'|
```

Let me break this down:
1. The first part: `forall i :: 0 <= i <= |brackets| ==> |set j | 0 <= j < i && brackets[j] == '<'| >= |set j | 0 <= j < i && brackets[j] == '>'|`
   This says that at every prefix position i, the number of '<' is >= number of '>'
2. The second part: `|set j | 0 <= j < |brackets| && brackets[j] == '<'| == |set j | 0 <= j < |brackets| && brackets[j] == '>'|`
   This says that the total number of '<' equals the total number of '>'
   
I'll verify the conditions by examining the validation process. The function ensures balanced brackets by checking two key constraints: maintaining a non-negative bracket count and achieving equal total '<' and '>' characters. This means the bracket sequence must never have more closing brackets than opening brackets at any point, and must end with an exactly balanced count.

The test cases demonstrate this elegantly across different scenarios, showing how the algorithm handles various bracket combinations. Each example validates the core logic by tracking prefix counts and ensuring the critical balance requirements are met throughout the traversal.

I'll verify the implementation's invariant, which precisely captures two key constraints: maintaining a non-negative counter and tracking the exact differential between opening and closing brackets at each point. This mathematical representation ensures the bracketing remains valid by preventing premature closing brackets and maintaining strict count symmetry.

The specification rigorously defines the bracketing correctness through these elegant mathematical conditions, confirming the algorithm's robust design.
