You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python


def largest_prime_factor(n: int):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime.
    >>> largest_prime_factor(13195)
    29
    >>> largest_prime_factor(2048)
    2
    """

def largest_prime_factor(n: int):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime.
    >>> largest_prime_factor(13195)
    29
    >>> largest_prime_factor(2048)
    2
    """
    largest_factor = 1
    
    # Check for factor 2
    while n % 2 == 0:
        largest_factor = 2
        n = n // 2
    
    # Check for odd factors starting from 3
    factor = 3
    while factor * factor <= n:
        while n % factor == 0:
            largest_factor = factor
            n = n // factor
        factor += 2
    
    # If n is still greater than 1, then it's a prime factor
    if n > 1:
        largest_factor = n
    
    return largest_factor
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `largest_prime_factor`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function first:

1. The function takes an integer `n` and returns the largest prime factor of `n`.
2. The assumption is that `n > 1` and `n` is not a prime.
3. The algorithm:
   - First checks for factor 2 (even factors)
   - Then checks for odd factors starting from 3
   - If after all this, n is still > 1, then n itself is the largest prime factor

Let me think about the Dafny translation:

**Types:**
- Input: `int` (maps to Dafny `int`)
- Output: `int` (maps to Dafny `int`)

**Preconditions:**
- `n > 1`
- `n` is not prime (though this might be hard to express directly)

**Postconditions:**
- The returned value is a prime factor of the original `n`
- The returned value is the largest prime factor of the original `n`

**Loop invariants:**
For the first while loop (checking factor 2):
- `n` is the remaining part after dividing out all factors of 2
- `largest_factor` is either 1 (no factors found yet) or 2

For the second nested while loops:
- `factor` is the current odd factor being checked
- `n` is the remaining part after dividing out all factors up to `factor-2`
- `largest_factor` is the largest prime factor found so far

**Termination:**
- The first while loop terminates because `n` decreases (by division by 2)
- The outer while loop terminates because `factor` increases and `factor * factor <= n`
- The inner while loop terminates because `n` decreases (by division by `factor`)

However, I need to be careful about how to express "is prime" and "largest prime factor" in Dafny. Let me think about helper functions I might need.
 
I'm refining the postcondition approach to ensure the returned value meets specific criteria:
1. The returned value must divide the original input
2. The returned value needs to be prime
3. No larger prime factor can exist

The termination conditions require careful consideration:
- First loop: `n` decreases through division
- Outer loop: Bound `factor * factor <= n` must eventually become false
- Inner loop: `n` decreases through repeated division

This approach demands precise mathematical reasoning to validate the algorithm's correctness and termination properties. I'll need to develop a systematic method to prove these conditions in Dafny.

The implementation begins by handling the special case of factor 2, then systematically checks odd factors starting from 3. The goal is to find the largest prime factor through a methodical elimination process.

I iterate through potential factors, dividing the number down and tracking the largest factor encountered. When no more factors can be found, I check if the remaining value itself is prime, which would then become the largest prime factor.

The termination condition involves carefully reducing the current number while ensuring the algorithm converges, with built-in invariants to maintain the correctness of the largest factor tracking.

The method guarantees finding the largest prime factor by progressively dividing out smaller factors and updating the largest factor accordingly, with a final check to handle prime numbers greater than the square root of the original input. The algorithm explores termination conditions for a loop, examining how `current_n` and `factor` interact. The goal is to find a decreases clause that guarantees the loop will eventually stop. Different approaches are considered, including tracking the relationship between `factor` and `current_n`, exploring lexicographic ordering, and ensuring progress through careful metric selection. The key challenge is designing a termination measure that captures the loop's fundamental progression.

The core insight reveals two potential loop exit scenarios: either `current_n` directly reduces or `factor` grows large enough to exceed `current_n`'s square root range. This suggests using `current_n` as the primary termination metric, which naturally tracks the algorithm's convergence.

--- RESPONSE ---
<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Types**: The function takes an `int` and returns an `int`, which maps directly to Dafny types.

2. **Logic**: The algorithm finds the largest prime factor by:
   - First dividing out all factors of 2
   - Then checking odd factors from 3 upwards
   - If a remainder > 1 exists after factoring, it's itself a prime factor

3. **Preconditions**: 
   - `n > 1` (given in documentation)
   - The documentation also says `n` is not prime, but this is hard to express directly in Dafny

4. **Postconditions**:
   - The result should be a factor of the original `n`
   - The result should be prime
   - The result should be the largest such prime factor

5. **Loop invariants and termination**:
   - First while loop: `n` decreases by division by 2
   - Outer while loop: terminates when `factor * factor > n`
   - Inner while loop: `n` decreases by division by `factor`

The main challenge is expressing the mathematical properties (prime, largest prime factor) in Dafny. I'll focus on a working implementation with basic correctness properties.

  if current_n > 1 {
