=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python
from typing import List


def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """ Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.
    For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
    E.g. (()()) has maximum two levels of nesting while ((())) has three.

    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
    [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """

    [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """
    # Split the string by spaces to get individual groups
    groups = paren_string.split()
    result = []
    
    for group in groups:
        current_depth = 0
        max_depth = 0
        
        # Iterate through each character in the group
        for char in group:
            if char == '(':
                current_depth += 1
                max_depth = max(max_depth, current_depth)
            elif char == ')':
                current_depth -= 1
        
        result.append(max_depth)
    
    return result
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `parse_nested_parens`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. The function takes a string of parentheses separated by spaces
2. For each group (separated by spaces), it calculates the maximum nesting depth
3. It returns a list of integers representing the max depth for each group

Let's break down the logic:
- Split the string by spaces to get groups
- For each group:
  - Track current depth and max depth
  - For each character:
    - If '(', increment current depth and update max depth
    - If ')', decrement current depth
  - Add max depth to result

Now for the Dafny implementation:

Types:
- Input: string
- Output: seq<int>

Pre-conditions:
- The input string should be well-formed (balanced parentheses in each group)
- Actually, looking at the code, it doesn't validate this, so I shouldn't require it either

Post-conditions:
- The result sequence has the same length as the number of groups
- Each element in the result is non-negative

I'll need helper methods to:
1. Split the string by spaces
2. Calculate max depth for a single group

Let me think about the split function - Dafny doesn't have a built-in split, so I'll need to implement it.

For the max depth calculation, I need to iterate through characters and track depth.

Let me write this step by step:

```dafny
method parse_nested_parens(paren_string: string) returns (result: seq<int>)
{
    var groups := split_by_spaces(paren_string);
    result := [];
    
    var i := 0;
    while i < |groups|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |groups|
        invariant |result| == i
    {
        var max_depth := calculate_max_depth(groups[i]);
        result := result + [max_depth];
        i := i + 1;
    }


}
```

I'll implement two key helper methods to complete the function. The split method will carefully parse the input string, identifying spaces to separate groups. The max depth calculation will systematically track parenthesis nesting, incrementing and decrementing a depth counter while keeping track of the maximum reached depth.

--- RESPONSE ---
<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Types**: The function takes a `str` and returns a `List[int]`. In Dafny, this maps to `string` input and `seq<int>` output.

2. **Logic**: 
   - Split the input string by spaces to get individual parentheses groups
   - For each group, calculate the maximum nesting depth by tracking current depth
   - When encountering '(', increment depth; when encountering ')', decrement depth
   - Track the maximum depth reached for each group

3. **Pre-conditions**: The function doesn't validate input, so I won't add strict requirements about well-formed parentheses.

4. **Post-conditions**: 
   - The result sequence length should match the number of groups
   - Each depth value should be non-negative

5. **Helper methods needed**:
   - A method to split string by spaces (since Dafny doesn't have built-in split)
   - A method to calculate max depth for a single group

6. **Loop invariants**: For the main loop iterating through groups, I need to maintain that the result length matches the current index.
