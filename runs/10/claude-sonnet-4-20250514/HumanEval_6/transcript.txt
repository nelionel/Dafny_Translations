You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

from typing import List


def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """ Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.
    For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
    E.g. (()()) has maximum two levels of nesting while ((())) has three.

    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
    [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Split the input string by spaces to get individual groups of parentheses
2. For each group, find the maximum depth of nested parentheses
3. Return a list of the maximum depths for each group

To find the maximum depth for a group, I'll track the current depth as I iterate through each character:
- When I encounter '(', I increase the current depth
- When I encounter ')', I decrease the current depth
- I keep track of the maximum depth seen so far

```python
from typing import List


def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """ Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.
    For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
    E.g. (()()) has maximum two levels of nesting while ((())) has three.

    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
    [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """
    # Split the string by spaces to get individual groups
    groups = paren_string.split()
    result = []
    
    for group in groups:
        current_depth = 0
        max_depth = 0
        
        # Iterate through each character in the group
        for char in group:
            if char == '(':
                current_depth += 1
                max_depth = max(max_depth, current_depth)
            elif char == ')':
                current_depth -= 1
        
        result.append(max_depth)
    
    return result
```
