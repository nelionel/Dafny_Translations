=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `sum_to_n`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python


METADATA = {}


def check(candidate):
    assert candidate(1) == 1
    assert candidate(6) == 21
    assert candidate(11) == 66
    assert candidate(30) == 465
    assert candidate(100) == 5050


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method sum_to_n(n: int) returns (result: int)
    requires n >= 0
    ensures result == n * (n + 1) / 2
{
    result := n * (n + 1) / 2;
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`sum_to_n`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `sum_to_n` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `sum_to_n` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the provided Python test code and Dafny solution.

1. The Python test code tests a function called `candidate` with these assertions:
   - `candidate(1) == 1`
   - `candidate(6) == 21` 
   - `candidate(11) == 66`
   - `candidate(30) == 465`
   - `candidate(100) == 5050`

2. The Dafny solution shows a method called `sum_to_n` with signature:
   ```dafny
   method sum_to_n(n: int) returns (result: int)
       requires n >= 0
       ensures result == n * (n + 1) / 2
   ```

3. Looking at the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`, this is the formula for the sum of first n natural numbers:
   - For n=1: 1*(1+1)/2 = 1*2/2 = 1 ✓
   - For n=6: 6*(6+1)/2 = 6*7/2 = 42/2 = 21 ✓  
   - For n=11: 11*(11+1)/2 = 11*12/2 = 132/2 = 66 ✓
   - For n=30: 30*(30+1)/2 = 30*31/2 = 930/2 = 465 ✓
   - For n=100: 100*(100+1)/2 = 100*101/2 = 10100/2 = 5050 ✓

So the tests are checking that `sum_to_n` correctly calculates the sum of first n natural numbers.

Now I need to:
1. Create a dummy implementation of `sum_to_n` that returns a default value (0 for int)


2. I'll craft test methods to validate the `sum_to_n` implementation using Dafny's `expect` statements. I'll create separate test methods for each input value, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the method's behavior across different inputs. Each test will verify the expected sum matches the calculated result, providing a rigorous validation of the method's correctness.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the Python test code and Dafny solution:

1. **Analysis:** The Python tests check a function that calculates the sum of first n natural numbers (1+2+...+n), which matches the Dafny `sum_to_n` method that implements the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`.

2. **Dummy Implementation:**

<dummy>
method sum_to_n(n: int) returns (result: int)
{
    result := 0;
}
</dummy>

3. **Translated Tests:**

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := sum_to_n(1);
    expect result == 1;
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := sum_to_n(6);
    expect result == 21;
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := sum_to_n(11);
    expect result == 66;
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := sum_to_n(30);
    expect result == 465;
}

method {:test} test_4()
{
    var result := sum_to_n(100);
    expect result == 5050;
}
```
