======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def sum_to_n(n: int):
    """sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
    >>> sum_to_n(30)

    >>> sum_to_n(100)
    5050
    >>> sum_to_n(5)

    1
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Here's the implementation of the `sum_to_n` function:

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int):
    """sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
    >>> sum_to_n(30)
    465
    >>> sum_to_n(100)
    5050
    >>> sum_to_n(5)
    15
    >>> sum_to_n(10)
    55
    >>> sum_to_n(1)
    1
    """
    return n * (n + 1) // 2
```

This implementation uses the mathematical formula for the sum of the first n positive integers: n × (n + 1) / 2. This is more efficient than using a loop as it runs in O(1) constant time regardless of the value of n.

The formula works because:
- The sum 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n can be calculated by pairing numbers from opposite ends
- For example, with n=5: (1+5) + (2+4) + 3 = 6 + 6 + 3 = 15
- In general, this gives us n × (n + 1) / 2

I used integer division (`//`) to ensure the result is always an integer, which is appropriate since we're summing integers.
