=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def fibfib(n: int):
    """The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:
    fibfib(0) == 0
    fibfib(1) == 0
    fibfib(2) == 1
    fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).
    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence.
    >>> fibfib(1)
    0
    >>> fibfib(5)
    4
    >>> fibfib(8)
    24
    """
    # Handle base cases
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    
    # Use dynamic programming for efficiency
    # Keep track of the last three values
    a, b, c = 0, 0, 1  # fibfib(0), fibfib(1), fibfib(2)
    
    # Compute iteratively from 3 to n
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        next_val = a + b + c
        a, b, c = b, c, next_val
    
    return c
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
function fibfib_spec(n: int): int
  requires n >= 0
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 then 0
  else if n == 1 then 0
  else if n == 2 then 1
  else fibfib_spec(n-1) + fibfib_spec(n-2) + fibfib_spec(n-3)
}

method fibfib(n: int) returns (result: int)
  requires n >= 0
  ensures result == fibfib_spec(n)
{
  if n == 0 {
    return 0;
  } else if n == 1 {
    return 0;
  } else if n == 2 {
    return 1;
  }
  
  var a, b, c := 0, 0, 1;  // fibfib(0), fibfib(1), fibfib(2)
  var i := 3;
  
  while i <= n
    invariant 3 <= i <= n + 1
    invariant a == fibfib_spec(i-3)
    invariant b == fibfib_spec(i-2)
    invariant c == fibfib_spec(i-1)
    decreases n - i
  {
    var next_val := a + b + c;
    a, b, c := b, c, next_val;
    i := i + 1;
  }
  
  return c;
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function and the Dafny code to see if the specifications are correct.

First, let me understand the Python function:
1. It implements the FibFib sequence as defined:
   - fibfib(0) == 0
   - fibfib(1) == 0 
   - fibfib(2) == 1
   - fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3) for n > 2

2. The function uses dynamic programming to compute this efficiently

Now let me look at the Dafny code:

1. The `fibfib_spec` function correctly defines the recursive specification:
   - Base cases: n=0 returns 0, n=1 returns 0, n=2 returns 1
   - Recursive case: fibfib_spec(n-1) + fibfib_spec(n-2) + fibfib_spec(n-3)

2. The method `fibfib` has:
   - `requires n >= 0` - this matches the Python function which expects non-negative integers
   - `ensures result == fibfib_spec(n)` - this ensures the result matches the specification

3. The loop invariants look correct:
   - `3 <= i <= n + 1` - bounds on the loop counter
   - `a == fibfib_spec(i-3)` - a holds the value three positions back
   - `b == fibfib_spec(i-2)` - b holds the value two positions back  
   - `c == fibfib_spec(i-1)` - c holds the value one position back

Let me trace through the logic:
- Initially: i=3, a=fibfib_spec(0)=0, b=fibfib_spec(1)=0, c=fibfib_spec(2)=1


- After first iteration: i=4, a=fibfib_spec(1)=0, b=fibfib_spec(2)=1, c=fibfib_spec(3)=0+0+1=1

I'll verify the iteration progression carefully. The sequence builds incrementally, with each step correctly computing the next FibFib number by summing the previous three values. The implementation demonstrates a robust approach to calculating the sequence efficiently.

The method handles the base cases explicitly and extends the calculation systematically. Each iteration updates the variables to maintain the correct sequence progression, ensuring accurate computation across different input values.

The specifications reveal several critical insights:
- Non-negative input requirement prevents invalid computations
- Mathematical definition is precisely captured
- Base cases and recursive structure are well-defined

The verification process confirms the implementation's correctness and adherence to the mathematical specification.
