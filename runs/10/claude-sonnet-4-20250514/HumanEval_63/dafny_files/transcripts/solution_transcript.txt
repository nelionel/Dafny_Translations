You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.

I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `fibfib`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. The function `fibfib` computes the n-th element of the FibFib sequence.
2. Base cases:
   - fibfib(0) = 0
   - fibfib(1) = 0  
   - fibfib(2) = 1
3. Recursive relation: fibfib(n) = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3) for n >= 3
4. The implementation uses dynamic programming to compute this efficiently in O(n) time.

For the Dafny translation, I need to:

1. **Types**: The function takes an `int` and returns an `int`, so this maps directly to Dafny.

2. **Preconditions**: The function should work for non-negative integers. So `requires n >= 0`.

3. **Postconditions**: I should ensure that the result follows the FibFib definition. I can define a recursive specification function and ensure the result matches it.

4. **Loop invariants**: The loop maintains that `a`, `b`, `c` represent fibfib(i-3), fibfib(i-2), fibfib(i-1) respectively at the start of iteration i.

5. **Termination**: The loop runs from 3 to n, so it terminates when i > n.

Let me write the Dafny code:

First, I'll define a specification function for fibfib:

```dafny
function fibfib_spec(n: int): int
  requires n >= 0
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 then 0
  else if n == 1 then 0
  else if n == 2 then 1
  else fibfib_spec(n-1) + fibfib_spec(n-2) + fibfib_spec(n-3)


}
```

I'll continue defining the method to implement the iterative approach for computing the FibFib sequence. The method will use a loop to progressively calculate the sequence values, maintaining three variables to track the previous three terms.

The implementation will start with the base cases handled separately, then use an iterative approach to build up to the nth term. I'll carefully track the loop invariants to ensure correctness.

The loop will incrementally compute the next FibFib number by summing the previous three terms, updating the tracking variables with each iteration. This approach allows efficient computation of the nth FibFib number with linear time complexity.

The key is maintaining the loop invariants that track the relationship between the current iteration and the FibFib sequence values, ensuring we correctly generate each successive term until we reach the desired nth term.

At each step, we calculate the next value by adding the previous three values, then shift our tracking variables to prepare for the next iteration. This sliding window approach lets us compute the sequence without storing the entire history of values.

The loop continues until we've computed the target index, with the final value of c representing the nth FibFib number we're seeking to calculate.

Our tracking variables maintain a precise relationship with the index, ensuring we always have the correct preceding values to compute the next number in the sequence.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Function Logic**: The `fibfib` function computes the n-th element of the FibFib sequence, which is defined as:
   - fibfib(0) = 0
   - fibfib(1) = 0
   - fibfib(2) = 1
   - fibfib(n) = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3) for n >= 3

2. **Types**: The function takes an `int` and returns an `int`, which maps directly to Dafny.

3. **Preconditions**: The function should work for non-negative integers, so `requires n >= 0`.

4. **Postconditions**: I need to ensure the result follows the FibFib definition. I'll create a specification function to define the mathematical relationship.

5. **Loop Analysis**: The loop uses dynamic programming, maintaining the last three FibFib values (a, b, c) and iterating from 3 to n. The loop invariant should maintain that a, b, c represent fibfib(i-3), fibfib(i-2), fibfib(i-1) respectively at iteration i.

6. **Termination**: The loop runs from 3 to n, so it terminates when i > n. The decreases clause should be `n - i`.
