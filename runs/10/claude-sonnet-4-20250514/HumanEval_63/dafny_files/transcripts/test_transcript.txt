=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `fibfib`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python


METADATA = {}


def check(candidate):
    assert candidate(2) == 1
    assert candidate(1) == 0
    assert candidate(5) == 4
    assert candidate(8) == 24
    assert candidate(10) == 81
    assert candidate(12) == 274
    assert candidate(14) == 927


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
function fibfib_spec(n: int): int
  requires n >= 0
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 then 0
  else if n == 1 then 0
  else if n == 2 then 1
  else fibfib_spec(n-1) + fibfib_spec(n-2) + fibfib_spec(n-3)
}

method fibfib(n: int) returns (result: int)
  requires n >= 0
  ensures result == fibfib_spec(n)
{
  if n == 0 {
    return 0;
  } else if n == 1 {
    return 0;
  } else if n == 2 {
    return 1;
  }
  
  var a, b, c := 0, 0, 1;  // fibfib(0), fibfib(1), fibfib(2)
  var i := 3;
  
  while i <= n
    invariant 3 <= i <= n + 1
    invariant a == fibfib_spec(i-3)
    invariant b == fibfib_spec(i-2)
    invariant c == fibfib_spec(i-1)
    decreases n - i
  {
    var next_val := a + b + c;
    a, b, c := b, c, next_val;
    i := i + 1;
  }
  
  return c;
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`fibfib`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `fibfib` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `fibfib` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the given code:

1. The Python test code tests a function called `candidate` with various inputs and expected outputs.
2. The Dafny solution code has a method called `fibfib` that takes an int and returns an int.
3. The tests are:
   - candidate(2) == 1
   - candidate(1) == 0  
   - candidate(5) == 4
   - candidate(8) == 24
   - candidate(10) == 81
   - candidate(12) == 274
   - candidate(14) == 927

Looking at the Dafny solution, the method signature is:
```dafny
method fibfib(n: int) returns (result: int)
  requires n >= 0
  ensures result == fibfib_spec(n)
```

So I need to create:
1. A dummy implementation of `fibfib` with the same signature
2. Test methods that call `fibfib` and check the results

For the dummy implementation, I need to match the signature exactly:
- Method name: `fibfib`
- Parameter: `n: int`
- Returns: `result: int`
- Requires: `n >= 0` (from the solution)

For the tests, I'll create test methods that call `fibfib(n)` and expect the result to match the expected value.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the Python tests and the Dafny solution code, I can see that:

1. The method to test is `fibfib` which takes an `int` parameter and returns an `int`
2. The method has a precondition `requires n >= 0`
3. The tests check various inputs and their expected outputs

<dummy>
method fibfib(n: int) returns (result: int)
  requires n >= 0
{
  result := 0;
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := fibfib(2);
    expect result == 1;
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := fibfib(1);
    expect result == 0;
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := fibfib(5);
    expect result == 4;
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := fibfib(8);
    expect result == 24;
}

method {:test} test_4()
{
    var result := fibfib(10);
    expect result == 81;
}

method {:test} test_5()
{
    var result := fibfib(12);
    expect result == 274;
}

method {:test} test_6()
{
    var result := fibfib(14);
    expect result == 927;
}
```
