=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `digitSum`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python
def check(candidate):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate("") == 0, "Error"
    assert candidate("abAB") == 131, "Error"
    assert candidate("abcCd") == 67, "Error"
    assert candidate("helloE") == 69, "Error"
    assert candidate("woArBld") == 131, "Error"
    assert candidate("aAaaaXa") == 153, "Error"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate(" How are yOu?") == 151, "Error"
    assert candidate("You arE Very Smart") == 327, "Error"


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method digitSum(s: string) returns (result: int)
    ensures result >= 0
{
    var total := 0;
    var i := 0;
    
    while i < |s|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
        invariant total >= 0
        decreases |s| - i
    {
        if 'A' <= s[i] <= 'Z' {
            total := total + (s[i] as int);
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    
    result := total;
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`digitSum`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `digitSum` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `digitSum` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the provided code:

1. The method to test is `digitSum` based on the Dafny solution code.
2. Looking at the Dafny solution, the signature is: `method digitSum(s: string) returns (result: int)`
3. The method processes a string and returns an integer (the sum of ASCII values of uppercase letters).

Now let me look at the Python tests:
- `candidate("")` should return `0`
- `candidate("abAB")` should return `131`
- `candidate("abcCd")` should return `67`
- `candidate("helloE")` should return `69`
- `candidate("woArBld")` should return `131`
- `candidate("aAaaaXa")` should return `153`
- `candidate(" How are yOu?")` should return `151`
- `candidate("You arE Very Smart")` should return `327`

I need to create:
1. A dummy implementation that has the same signature but returns a default value
2. Test methods that call digitSum and check the expected results

For the dummy implementation, since it returns an int, I'll return 0.

For the tests, I need to translate each assert into a test method.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the code, I need to test the `digitSum` method which takes a string and returns an int.

<dummy>
method digitSum(s: string) returns (result: int)
{
    result := 0;
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := digitSum("");
    expect result == 0;
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := digitSum("abAB");
    expect result == 131;
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := digitSum("abcCd");
    expect result == 67;
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := digitSum("helloE");
    expect result == 69;
}

method {:test} test_4()
{
    var result := digitSum("woArBld");
    expect result == 131;
}

method {:test} test_5()
{
    var result := digitSum("aAaaaXa");
    expect result == 153;
}

method {:test} test_6()
{
    var result := digitSum(" How are yOu?");
    expect result == 151;
}

method {:test} test_7()
{
    var result := digitSum("You arE Very Smart");
    expect result == 327;
}
```
