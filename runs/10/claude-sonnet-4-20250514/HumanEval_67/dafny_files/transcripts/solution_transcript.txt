You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def fruit_distribution(s,n):
    """
    In this task, you will be given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges 
    that are distributed in a basket of fruit this basket contains 
    apples, oranges, and mango fruits. Given the string that represents the total number of 
    the oranges and apples and an integer that represent the total number of the fruits 
    in the basket return the number of the mango fruits in the basket.
    for examble:
    fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19) ->19 - 5 - 6 = 8
    fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges",3) -> 3 - 0 - 1 = 2
    fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100) -> 100 - 2 - 3 = 95
    fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges",120) -> 120 - 100 - 1 = 19

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `fruit_distribution`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function step by step:

1. The function takes a string `s` and an integer `n`.
2. It extracts all numbers from the string using regex.
3. It sums all the extracted numbers (representing apples and oranges).
4. It returns `n - total_apples_oranges` (the number of mangoes).

For the Dafny translation:
- I need to implement string parsing to extract numbers from the string
- The input types will be `string` and `int`
- The return type will be `int`
- I need to handle the case where the string contains digits

Since Dafny doesn't have regex built-in, I'll need to implement a way to extract numbers from the string. I can iterate through the string character by character and extract digit sequences.

Let me think about the preconditions:
- The total number of fruits `n` should be non-negative
- The sum of apples and oranges should not exceed the total number of fruits

Let me think about the postconditions:
- The result should be non-negative (assuming valid input)
- The result should equal `n - (sum of extracted numbers)`

For the implementation, I'll need helper functions to:
1. Check if a character is a digit
2. Extract all numbers from the string
3. Sum the extracted numbers

Let me implement this step by step.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Function Logic**: The function extracts all digit sequences from a string using regex, converts them to integers, sums them up (representing apples and oranges), and subtracts this sum from the total number of fruits to get the number of mangoes.

2. **Types**: 
   - Input: `string` and `int`
   - Output: `int`

3. **Preconditions**: 
   - The total number of fruits `n` should be non-negative
   - The sum of apples and oranges should not exceed `n`

4. **Postconditions**: 
   - The result should be `n` minus the sum of all numbers extracted from the string
   - The result should be non-negative (assuming valid input)

5. **Implementation Strategy**: Since Dafny doesn't have regex, I'll need to:
   - Create a helper function to check if a character is a digit
   - Create a helper function to extract all numbers from the string
   - Sum the extracted numbers and subtract from `n`

6. **No loops or recursion in the main function**, but I'll need helper functions that may use recursion to parse the string.
