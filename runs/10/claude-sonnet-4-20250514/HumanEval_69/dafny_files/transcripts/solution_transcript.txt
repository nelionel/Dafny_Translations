=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def search(lst):
    '''
    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than 
    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. 
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such a value exist, return -1.
    Examples:
        search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2
        search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3
        search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1
    '''

        search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1
    '''
    # Count frequency of each number
    frequency = {}
    for num in lst:
        frequency[num] = frequency.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Find numbers where frequency >= value
    valid_numbers = []
    for num, freq in frequency.items():
        if freq >= num:
            valid_numbers.append(num)
    
    # Return the greatest valid number, or -1 if none exist
    if valid_numbers:
        return max(valid_numbers)
    else:
        return -1
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `search`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. It takes a list of positive integers as input
2. Counts the frequency of each number using a dictionary
3. Finds numbers where frequency >= the number value itself
4. Returns the maximum of such valid numbers, or -1 if none exist

For the Dafny translation:
- Input: `seq<int>` (sequence of integers)
- Output: `int` (the greatest valid number or -1)
- Need helper functions/methods to count frequencies
- Need to ensure the input contains only positive integers

Requirements analysis:
- Pre-condition: the sequence is non-empty and contains only positive integers
- Post-condition: 
  - If result is -1, then no number in the sequence has frequency >= its value
  - If result > 0, then result appears in the sequence with frequency >= result value, and no larger number has this property

I'll need helper functions:
1. Count frequency of a number in a sequence
2. Check if a number satisfies the condition (frequency >= value)
3. Find all valid numbers
4. Find maximum of valid numbers

Let me implement this step by step.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Input/Output Types**: The function takes a list of positive integers and returns an integer (either the greatest valid number or -1).
   - Python `list` → Dafny `seq<int>`
   - Python `int` return → Dafny `int` return

2. **Logic Analysis**:
   - Count frequency of each number in the list
   - Find numbers where frequency ≥ the number's value
   - Return the maximum of such valid numbers, or -1 if none exist

3. **Pre-conditions**:
   - The sequence is non-empty
   - All elements are positive integers

4. **Post-conditions**:
   - If result is -1, no number satisfies the frequency condition
   - If result > 0, it's the greatest number that satisfies the condition

5. **Helper functions needed**:
   - Function to count frequency of a number in sequence
   - Function to check if a number satisfies the condition
   - Logic to find all valid numbers and their maximum

6. **Loops**: I'll need loops to iterate through the sequence, which will require loop invariants and termination proofs.
