=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def strange_sort_list(lst):
    '''
    Given list of integers, return list in strange order.
    Strange sorting, is when you start with the minimum value,
    then maximum of the remaining integers, then minimum and so on.

    Examples:
    strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 2, 3]
    strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5, 5, 5, 5]
    strange_sort_list([]) == []
    '''

def strange_sort_list(lst):
    '''
    Given list of integers, return list in strange order.
    Strange sorting, is when you start with the minimum value,
    then maximum of the remaining integers, then minimum and so on.

    Examples:
    strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 2, 3]
    strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5, 5, 5, 5]
    strange_sort_list([]) == []
    '''
    if not lst:
        return []
    
    # Create a copy to avoid modifying the original list
    remaining = lst.copy()
    result = []
    pick_min = True  # Start with minimum
    
    while remaining:
        if pick_min:
            value = min(remaining)
        else:
            value = max(remaining)
        
        result.append(value)
        remaining.remove(value)  # Remove first occurrence of the value
        pick_min = not pick_min  # Alternate between min and max
    
    return result
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `strange_sort_list`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze this Python function:

1. It takes a list of integers and returns a list with a "strange" sorting order.
2. The algorithm alternates between picking the minimum and maximum from the remaining elements.
3. It starts with minimum, then max, then min, etc.

For the Dafny translation:
- Input: `seq<int>` (sequence of integers)
- Output: `seq<int>` (sequence of integers)
- The function modifies a copy of the input and removes elements one by one

Key considerations:
1. I need to implement finding min/max of a sequence
2. I need to implement removing an element from a sequence
3. I need loop invariants for the while loop
4. I need to ensure termination (the remaining sequence gets smaller each iteration)

Let me think about the algorithm:
1. If input is empty, return empty
2. Create a copy of input
3. Initialize result as empty, pick_min as true
4. While remaining is not empty:
   - If pick_min, find minimum, else find maximum
   - Add to result
   - Remove that element from remaining
   - Toggle pick_min

For Dafny implementation:
- I'll need helper functions for finding min/max of a sequence
- I'll need a helper function to remove the first occurrence of an element
- The main loop will need invariants about the lengths and contents

Termination: The length of `remaining` decreases by 1 each iteration.

Let me write the helper functions first, then the main method.

--- RESPONSE ---
<thinking>
Let me analyze this Python function:

1. **Types**: The function takes a list of integers and returns a list of integers. In Dafny, this maps to `seq<int>` for both input and output.

2. **Logic**: The algorithm alternates between picking the minimum and maximum values from the remaining elements. It starts with minimum, then maximum, then minimum, etc.

3. **Key operations needed**:
   - Find minimum/maximum of a sequence
   - Remove first occurrence of an element from a sequence
   - Main loop that alternates between min/max selection

4. **Pre/post conditions**:
   - No specific preconditions needed (works with any sequence)
   - Post-condition should ensure the result has the same length as input and contains the same elements (multiset equality)

5. **Loop invariants**: 
   - The sum of lengths of `result` and `remaining` equals the original input length
   - The multiset union of `result` and `remaining` equals the original input
   - `pick_min` alternates correctly

6. **Termination**: The length of `remaining` decreases by exactly 1 each iteration, so `decreases |remaining|` works.

I'll need helper functions for finding min/max and removing elements, plus the main method.
