You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

======USER PROMPT======

def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise return -1
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.
    Example:
    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00
    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1
    '''


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Here's the implementation of the `triangle_area` function:

```python
def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise return -1
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.
    Example:
    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00
    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1
    '''
    # Check if the three sides form a valid triangle
    # The triangle inequality states that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side
    if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:
        # Calculate the semi-perimeter
        s = (a + b + c) / 2
        
        # Use Heron's formula to calculate the area
        # Area = sqrt(s * (s-a) * (s-b) * (s-c))
        area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5
        
        # Round to 2 decimal places
        return round(area, 2)
    else:
        # Invalid triangle
        return -1
```

The function works as follows:

1. **Triangle Validation**: First, it checks if the three sides form a valid triangle using the triangle inequality theorem. For a valid triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

2. **Heron's Formula**: If the triangle is valid, it calculates the area using Heron's formula:
   - Calculate the semi-perimeter: `s = (a + b + c) / 2`
   - Calculate the area: `Area = √(s × (s-a) × (s-b) × (s-c))`

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the area rounded to 2 decimal places for valid triangles, or -1 for invalid triangles.

The examples work correctly:
- `triangle_area(3, 4, 5)` returns `6.00` (a valid right triangle)
- `triangle_area(1, 2, 10)` returns `-1` (invalid since 1 + 2 = 3 < 10)
