=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `will_it_fly`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python
def check(candidate):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert candidate([3, 2, 3], 9) is True
    assert candidate([1, 2], 5) is False
    assert candidate([3], 5) is True
    assert candidate([3, 2, 3], 1) is False


    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert candidate([1, 2, 3], 6) is False
    assert candidate([5], 5) is True


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method will_it_fly(q: seq<int>, w: int) returns (result: bool)
  ensures result == (IsPalindrome(q) && Sum(q) <= w)
{
    var is_balanced := IsPalindrome(q);
    var is_within_weight := Sum(q) <= w;
    result := is_balanced && is_within_weight;
}

function IsPalindrome(s: seq<int>): bool
{
    s == Reverse(s)
}

function Reverse(s: seq<int>): seq<int>
  decreases |s|
{
    if |s| == 0 then []
    else [s[|s|-1]] + Reverse(s[..|s|-1])
}

function Sum(s: seq<int>): int
  decreases |s|
{
    if |s| == 0 then 0
    else s[0] + Sum(s[1..])
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`will_it_fly`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `will_it_fly` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `will_it_fly` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python test code and the Dafny solution:

1. The method to test is `will_it_fly` which takes a sequence of integers and an integer weight, and returns a boolean.

2. Looking at the Python tests:
- `candidate([3, 2, 3], 9) is True` - palindrome [3,2,3], sum is 8, 8 <= 9, so True
- `candidate([1, 2], 5) is False` - not palindrome [1,2], so False
- `candidate([3], 5) is True` - palindrome [3], sum is 3, 3 <= 5, so True
- `candidate([3, 2, 3], 1) is False` - palindrome [3,2,3], sum is 8, 8 > 1, so False
- `candidate([1, 2, 3], 6) is False` - not palindrome [1,2,3], so False
- `candidate([5], 5) is True` - palindrome [5], sum is 5, 5 <= 5, so True

3. The Dafny solution shows:
```dafny
method will_it_fly(q: seq<int>, w: int) returns (result: bool)
```

So I need to:
1. Create a dummy implementation with the same signature
2. Create test methods that call will_it_fly and use expect to verify results

For the dummy, I'll return false as the default boolean value.

For the tests, I need to convert Python lists to Dafny sequences using square brackets.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the Python tests and Dafny solution, I can see that:

1. The method `will_it_fly` takes a sequence of integers and a weight limit, returning a boolean
2. The tests check various combinations of palindromes and weight constraints
3. The method should return true if the sequence is a palindrome AND its sum is within the weight limit

<dummy>
method will_it_fly(q: seq<int>, w: int) returns (result: bool)
{
    result := false;
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9);
    expect result == true;
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := will_it_fly([1, 2], 5);
    expect result == false;
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := will_it_fly([3], 5);
    expect result == true;
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1);
    expect result == false;
}

method {:test} test_4()
{
    var result := will_it_fly([1, 2, 3], 6);
    expect result == false;
}

method {:test} test_5()
{
    var result := will_it_fly([5], 5);
    expect result == true;
}
```
