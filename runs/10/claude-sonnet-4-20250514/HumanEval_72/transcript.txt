You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

======USER PROMPT======

def will_it_fly(q,w):
    '''
    Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.
    The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.

    Example:
    will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) ➞ False 
    # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.

    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) ➞ False
    # it's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.

    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) ➞ True
    # 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.

    will_it_fly([3], 5) ➞ True
    # 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.
    '''


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to check two conditions:
1. The list `q` is balanced (palindromic) - reads the same forwards and backwards
2. The sum of elements in `q` is less than or equal to the maximum weight `w`

The object will fly only if both conditions are true.

```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    '''
    Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.
    The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.

    Example:
    will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) ➞ False 
    # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.

    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) ➞ False
    # it's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.

    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) ➞ True
    # 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.

    will_it_fly([3], 5) ➞ True
    # 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.
    '''
    # Check if the list is balanced (palindromic)
    is_balanced = q == q[::-1]
    
    # Check if the sum is within the weight limit
    is_within_weight = sum(q) <= w
    
    # Return True only if both conditions are met
    return is_balanced and is_within_weight
```

The solution works by:
1. Checking if `q` is palindromic by comparing it with its reverse (`q[::-1]`)
2. Checking if the sum of all elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight `w`
3. Returning `True` only when both conditions are satisfied using the `and` operator
