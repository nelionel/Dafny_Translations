You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def is_multiply_prime(a):
    """Write a function that returns true if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers
    and false otherwise.
    Knowing that (a) is less then 100. 
    Example:
    is_multiply_prime(30) == True
    30 = 2 * 3 * 5
    """

        if n < 2:
            return False
        if n == 2:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return False
        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    # Handle edge cases
    if a < 8:  # Minimum product of 3 primes is 2*2*2 = 8
        return False
    
    # Count prime factors
    prime_factor_count = 0
    temp = a
    
    # Check for factor 2
    while temp % 2 == 0:
        prime_factor_count += 1
        temp //= 2
    
    # Check for odd prime factors
    i = 3
    while i * i <= temp:
        while temp % i == 0:
            prime_factor_count += 1
            temp //= i
        i += 2
    
    # If temp > 1, then it's a prime factor
    if temp > 1:
        prime_factor_count += 1
    
    return prime_factor_count == 3
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `is_multiply_prime`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python code step by step:

1. **Function purpose**: The function checks if a number is the product of exactly 3 prime numbers.

2. **Input types**: The function takes an integer `a` as input (Python int maps to Dafny int).

3. **Return type**: The function returns a boolean (Python bool maps to Dafny bool).

4. **Logic analysis**:
   - There's a helper function `is_prime` that checks if a number is prime
   - The main logic counts the number of prime factors of `a`
   - It returns true if there are exactly 3 prime factors (counting multiplicities)

5. **Pre-conditions**: 
   - The documentation says `a` is less than 100, so we can add `requires a < 100`
   - We should also require `a >= 0` for safety

6. **Post-conditions**: 
   - The result should be true iff `a` is the product of exactly 3 prime numbers
   - This is hard to specify formally without defining what "prime factor count" means

7. **Loop analysis**:
   - There's a while loop `while temp % 2 == 0` that divides out factors of 2
   - There's another while loop `while i * i <= temp` that checks odd factors
   - Inside that, there's `while temp % i == 0` that divides out factors of `i`

8. **Termination**:
   - The loops terminate because `temp` is getting smaller in each iteration
   - The outer loop terminates because `i` increases and eventually `i * i > temp`

Let me implement this step by step:

```dafny
method is_multiply_prime(a: int) returns (result: bool)
  requires a >= 0 && a < 100
{
  // Helper function equivalent
  function is_prime(n: int): bool
    requires n >= 0
  {
    if n < 2 then false
    else if n == 2 then true  
    else if n % 2 == 0 then false
    else is_prime_odd(n, 3)
  }
  
  function is_prime_odd(n: int, i: int): bool
    requires n >= 3 && n % 2 == 1
    requires i >= 3 && i % 2 == 1
    decreases n - i
  {
    if i * i > n then true
    else if n % i == 0 then false
    else is_prime_odd(n, i + 2)
  }

I'll break down the prime checking logic:
- The function handles different cases for primality
- For even numbers, it quickly determines non-primality
- For odd numbers, it uses a recursive approach to check divisibility
- The function checks divisibility by odd numbers starting from 3
- It stops when the square of the divisor exceeds the number or a divisor is found

The method needs restructuring to comply with Dafny's function definition rules. I'll separate the prime checking logic into distinct functions with clear requirements and termination conditions.

The key is tracking prime factors systematically while ensuring the verification process can prove termination. By incrementing the search factor and checking against the square root, we create a provable algorithm for prime factorization.

I'll modify the approach to explicitly track the reduction of the search space, ensuring each iteration moves closer to a termination condition. The goal is to count prime factors efficiently while maintaining Dafny's strict verification constraints.

The method will incrementally divide out known prime factors, tracking the count and progressively reducing the input number until no more factors can be found.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python code:

1. **Function purpose**: Check if a number is the product of exactly 3 prime numbers (counting multiplicities).

2. **Input/Output types**: Takes an integer `a`, returns a boolean.

3. **Logic**: 
   - Uses a helper function `is_prime` to check primality
   - Counts prime factors by trial division
   - Returns true if exactly 3 prime factors found

4. **Pre-conditions**: The documentation states `a < 100`, and we should ensure `a >= 0` for safety.

5. **Loops and termination**:
   - `while temp % 2 == 0`: terminates because `temp` decreases
   - `while i * i <= temp`: terminates because `i` increases 
   - Inner `while temp % i == 0`: terminates because `temp` decreases

6. **Implementation considerations**:
   - Need helper functions for primality testing
   - Need to handle the prime factorization logic with proper loop invariants
   - The helper function `is_prime` isn't actually used in the main logic, so I can omit it
