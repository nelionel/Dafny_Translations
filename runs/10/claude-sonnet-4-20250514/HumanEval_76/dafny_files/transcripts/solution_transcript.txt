**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `is_simple_power`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function step by step:

1. The function `is_simple_power(x, n)` checks if `x` is a simple power of `n`, meaning there exists an integer `k` such that `n^k = x`.

2. Edge cases handled:
   - If `n == 1`: only `x == 1` returns true (since 1^k = 1 for any k)
   - If `n == 0`: only `x == 0` returns true (0^k = 0 for k > 0, and 0^0 is undefined but often considered 1)
   - If `x == 1`: return true (any n^0 = 1 for n != 0)
   - If `x == 0`: return false (handled after n == 0 case)

3. For negative `n`: the logic becomes complex with logarithms, but the basic idea is still to find an integer k such that n^k = x.

4. For positive `n` and `x`: use logarithms to check if log_n(x) is close to an integer.

For Dafny translation, I need to think about:

1. **Types**: Both `x` and `n` appear to be integers based on the examples, but the implementation uses floating-point logarithms. In Dafny, I'll use `int` for both parameters.

2. **No floating-point logarithms**: Dafny doesn't have built-in logarithm functions like Python's math.log. I'll need to implement this differently, perhaps by iteratively checking powers.

3. **Edge cases**: I need to handle the same edge cases but without floating-point arithmetic.

4. **Algorithm**: Instead of using logarithms, I can:
   - For positive n > 1: keep multiplying by n until I either reach x or exceed it
   - For n = 1: check if x = 1
   - For n = 0: check if x = 0
   - For negative n: handle the cases more carefully

I'll focus on implementing specific handling for zero and negative cases. The zero case requires checking if x is exactly zero. For negative numbers, the power calculation becomes more intricate, potentially involving sign changes and absolute value considerations. This approach ensures robust handling of edge scenarios beyond simple positive integer powers. I'll handle the special cases for n == -1 and n < -1, exploring power relationships carefully. When n is -1, I'll check for specific values that can result from even or odd exponents. For negative bases less than -1, I recognize a more complex scenario involving potential positive and negative power outcomes. I'll need to investigate power generation systematically, tracking potential matches while preventing overflow and considering the sign dynamics carefully.

The method will methodically explore power transformations, checking whether the target value can be generated through different exponent configurations. I'll track power progression, examining both positive and negative potential results to determine if a valid power relationship exists between the base and target value.

My approach involves incrementally building powers, comparing against the target, and managing sign transitions to capture the nuanced power relationship comprehensively. I'll ensure efficient traversal while maintaining precise mathematical constraints.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Function purpose**: Check if `x` is a simple power of `n`, meaning there exists an integer `k` such that `n^k = x`.

2. **Types**: The parameters appear to be integers based on the examples, so I'll use `int` for both in Dafny.

3. **Edge cases handled**:
   - `n == 1`: only returns true if `x == 1` (since 1^k = 1 for any k)
   - `n == 0`: only returns true if `x == 0` 
   - `x == 1`: returns true (since n^0 = 1 for any n â‰  0)
   - `x == 0`: returns false (after handling n == 0 case)

4. **Algorithm challenges**: The Python code uses floating-point logarithms which aren't available in Dafny. Instead, I'll iterate through powers of n until I either find x or determine it's impossible.

5. **Approach**: For the general case, I'll compute successive powers of n (n^0, n^1, n^2, ...) until I either:
   - Find a power equal to x (return true)
   - Exceed x in absolute value (return false)
   - Detect we're in an infinite loop (for cases like n = -1)

6. **Termination**: The loops will terminate because either we find the answer or the powers grow beyond x (except for special cases like n = -1, which I'll handle separately).
