You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def iscube(a):
    '''
    Write a function that takes an integer a and returns True 
    if this ingeger is a cube of some integer number.
    Note: you may assume the input is always valid.
    Examples:
    iscube(1) ==> True

    iscube(180) ==> False
    '''

def iscube(a):
    '''
    Write a function that takes an integer a and returns True 
    if this ingeger is a cube of some integer number.
    Note: you may assume the input is always valid.
    Examples:

    '''
    if a == 0:
        return True
    
    # Handle negative numbers
    if a < 0:
        # For negative numbers, we need the cube root of the absolute value
        cube_root = round((-a) ** (1/3))
        return (-cube_root) ** 3 == a
    else:
        # For positive numbers
        cube_root = round(a ** (1/3))
        return cube_root ** 3 == a
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `iscube`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze this Python function:

1. The function `iscube` takes an integer `a` and returns `True` if it's a perfect cube.
2. It handles special cases:
   - If `a == 0`, return `True` (since 0^3 = 0)
   - If `a < 0`, it finds the cube root of the absolute value and checks if the negative cube equals `a`
   - If `a > 0`, it finds the cube root and checks if the cube equals `a`

The logic uses floating point arithmetic (`a ** (1/3)`) and `round()`, which might introduce precision issues. In Dafny, I'll need to implement this differently since we can't rely on floating point cube roots.

For Dafny implementation:
- Input type: `int`
- Return type: `bool`
- I need to find an integer `x` such that `x * x * x == a`
- For negative numbers, I need to find `x` such that `x < 0` and `x * x * x == a`
- For positive numbers, I need to find `x` such that `x > 0` and `x * x * x == a`

Since we can't use floating point cube roots, I'll need to search for the cube root. I can do a binary search or a linear search. Given that we need to handle both positive and negative numbers, I'll use a search approach.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. The cube root of a number `a` is approximately `a^(1/3)`. For positive numbers, I can search from 0 to some upper bound. For negative numbers, I can search from some lower bound to 0.

For termination, if I use a loop to search, I need to ensure it terminates. I can use a bounded search.

Let me implement this step by step:

1. Handle the case where `a == 0`
2. For positive `a`, search for `x` from 0 to some reasonable upper bound where `x^3 == a`


3. For negative `a`, I'll need a systematic approach to find the correct negative cube root. I'll search from a lower bound towards zero, checking if the cube matches the input. This requires careful boundary handling to ensure I capture all possible negative cube roots accurately.

The search strategy will involve iterating through potential cube roots, comparing their cubes to the original number, and stopping when an exact match is found or the search bounds are exhausted.

For positive numbers, I'll establish precise upper bounds based on the input's magnitude. The cube root's range depends on whether the number is less than or greater than 1, which requires nuanced integer-based logic.

I'll develop a helper function that can precisely compute integer cube roots across different input scenarios, ensuring robust handling of positive and negative inputs.

My approach involves carefully analyzing how cube roots behave for different ranges:
- For small positive numbers under 8, the cube root relationship becomes complex
- Larger numbers reveal interesting mathematical constraints on root calculations
- The fundamental relationship `x^3 = a` guides my computational strategy

I need to develop a method that can accurately determine integer cube roots while respecting mathematical constraints across various input ranges. The bound `x <= a` holds for values greater than or equal to 1, with a clear pattern emerging from specific examples like 8 and 27. I'll verify this approach by implementing a method to check if a number is a perfect cube, using a systematic search strategy that incrementally tests potential cube roots.

The implementation uses a loop that checks cube values, starting from 1 and increasing until either finding an exact match or exceeding the target number. Careful loop invariants ensure the search's correctness, covering both positive and negative cases.

By adjusting the loop condition to strictly less than the target and checking equality after the loop, I can guarantee comprehensive coverage of potential cube roots while maintaining precise termination conditions.

For positive numbers, I'll increment from 1 upward, ensuring I don't miss the exact cube match. For negative numbers, I'll decrement from -1 downward, carefully tracking potential cube roots. The explicit bounds and invariants help prove the method's correctness across different input ranges.

The key strategy involves incrementing or decrementing a candidate value until it either matches the cube exactly or exceeds the search bounds, then performing a final equality check to confirm the cube root's existence.

I need to carefully consider the termination conditions and upper/lower bounds for different input scenarios, ensuring the method works reliably for zero, positive, and negative integers while maintaining computational efficiency.

For positive integers, I'll track the cube of x against the target value a, using a bounded search strategy that prevents unnecessary iterations. The key is establishing precise loop invariants that guarantee termination and correctness.

The approach involves incrementing x systematically, checking whether its cube matches or exceeds the input value, with explicit boundary conditions to handle edge cases like zero and perfect cubes.

By constraining x's range and using strategic incrementation, I can develop a method that efficiently determines whether a given integer is a perfect cube without relying on complex floating-point calculations. For positive $a$, the cube root bound holds when $a \geq 1$. If $x^3 = a$, then $x$ cannot exceed $a$ because for values larger than $a$, the cube would be significantly greater. This ensures $x \leq a$ is a valid constraint.

For negative $a$, the cube root is negative and follows a similar principle. When $a \leq -1$, the magnitude of $x$ is constrained by $|a|^{1/3}$, ensuring $x$ remains less than or equal to $a$. The relationship between $x$ and $a$ maintains a consistent bound for cube root calculations.

<thinking>
Let me analyze this Python function:

1. **Function Logic**: The function `iscube` takes an integer and returns `True` if it's a perfect cube of some integer.
2. **Key Cases**: 
   - `a == 0`: returns `True` (since 0³ = 0)
   - `a < 0`: finds cube root of absolute value, then checks if negative cube equals `a`
   - `a > 0`: finds cube root and checks if cube equals `a`

3. **Type Mapping**: 
   - Input: Python `int` → Dafny `int`
   - Output: Python `bool` → Dafny `bool`

4. **Implementation Strategy**: Since Dafny doesn't have built-in floating point cube roots, I'll need to search for an integer `x` such that `x³ = a`. I can use a bounded linear search.

5. **Bounds**: 
   - For positive `a ≥ 1`: if `x³ = a`, then `x ≤ a` (since cube root grows slower than the number itself for large values)
   - For negative `a ≤ -1`: if `x³ = a`, then `x ≥ a` (since `x` is negative)

6. **Termination**: The loops increment/decrement `x` within bounded ranges, so they will terminate.

    }
    
    if a > 0 {
        var x := 1;

            invariant x >= 1
            invariant forall y :: 1 <= y < x ==> y * y * y != a
            invariant x * x * x <= a ==> x <= a  // bound to ensure termination
            decreases if x * x * x <= a then a - x * x * x else 0
        {
            x := x + 1;
        }
        return x * x * x == a;
    } else {
        // a < 0
        var x := -1;
        while x * x * x > a
            invariant x <= -1  
            invariant forall y :: x < y <= -1 ==> y * y * y != a
            invariant x * x * x >= a ==> x >= a  // bound to ensure termination
            decreases if x * x * x >= a then x * x * x - a else 0
        {
            x := x - 1;
        }
        return x * x * x == a;
    }
