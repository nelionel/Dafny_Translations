You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def hex_key(num):
    """You have been tasked to write a function that receives 
    a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal 
    digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number 
    greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers).
    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...
    So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, 
    B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).
    Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, 
    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.
    Examples:
    For num = "AB" the output should be 1.
    For num = "1077E" the output should be 2.
    For num = "ABED1A33" the output should be 4.
    For num = "123456789ABCDEF0" the output should be 6.
    For num = "2020" the output should be 2.

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `hex_key`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze this Python function:

1. The function takes a string `num` representing a hexadecimal number
2. It counts how many characters in the string are hexadecimal digits that represent prime numbers
3. The prime hex digits are: '2', '3', '5', '7', 'B' (11), 'D' (13)
4. It returns the count as an integer

For the Dafny translation:
- Input: `string` (Dafny string type)
- Output: `int` (count of prime hex digits)
- Logic: iterate through each character in the string and count how many are in the set {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}

Pre-conditions:
- The input string should be valid (contains only valid hexadecimal characters)
- But the problem states we can assume input is always correct or empty string

Post-conditions:
- The result should be non-negative
- The result should be at most the length of the input string
- The result should equal the actual count of prime hex digits

For the loop:
- We'll iterate through the string using an index
- Loop invariant: count so far is correct for the characters processed
- Termination: the index increases and is bounded by string length

Let me write the Dafny code:

```dafny
method hex_key(num: string) returns (count: int)
  ensures count >= 0
  ensures count <= |num|
{
  count := 0;
  var i := 0;
  
  while i < |num|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |num|
    invariant count >= 0
    invariant count <= i
  {
    var digit := num[i];
    if digit == '2' || digit == '3' || digit == '5' || digit == '7' || digit == 'B' || digit == 'D' {
      count := count + 1;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
}
```

I'll focus on the implementation's core logic. The method increments the count when a prime hexadecimal digit is found. The loop invariants ensure the count remains within valid bounds throughout the iteration. The method provides a straightforward way to count prime hex digits in a given string.

<thinking>
Let me analyze this Python function:

1. **Function Analysis**: The function takes a hexadecimal string and counts how many characters are prime hex digits ('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D').

2. **Type Mapping**: 
   - Input: Python `str` → Dafny `string`
   - Output: Python `int` → Dafny `int`

3. **Logic**: Simple iteration through the string, checking each character against the set of prime hex digits.

4. **Pre-conditions**: The problem states we can assume input is always correct or empty, so no special requires clauses needed.

5. **Post-conditions**:
   - Result should be non-negative
   - Result should be at most the length of input string
   - Could add more precise condition about actual count

6. **Loop Analysis**:
   - Simple while loop with index-based iteration
   - Invariant: count tracks prime digits seen so far
   - Termination: index increases and is bounded by string length

7. **Implementation**: I'll iterate through the string using an index and check each character against the prime hex digits.
