You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert it to
    binary format. The function should return a string, with each character representing a binary
    number. Each character in the string will be '0' or '1'.

    There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.
    The extra characters are there to help with the format.

    Examples:
    decimal_to_binary(15)   # returns "db1111db"
    decimal_to_binary(32)   # returns "db100000db"
    """

def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert it to
    binary format. The function should return a string, with each character representing a binary
    number. Each character in the string will be '0' or '1'.

    There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.
    The extra characters are there to help with the format.

    Examples:
    decimal_to_binary(15)   # returns "db1111db"
    decimal_to_binary(32)   # returns "db100000db"
    """
    # Convert decimal to binary using bin() function and remove '0b' prefix
    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]
    
    # Add 'db' at the beginning and end
    return f"db{binary}db"
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `decimal_to_binary`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze this Python function step by step:

1. **Function analysis**: The function `decimal_to_binary` takes a decimal number and converts it to binary format, then wraps it with "db" at the beginning and end.

2. **Types**: 
   - Input: `decimal` is an integer
   - Output: a string

3. **Logic**:
   - Convert decimal to binary using `bin()` function and remove the '0b' prefix
   - Add 'db' at the beginning and end of the binary string
   - Return the result

4. **Pre-conditions**: 
   - The input should be a non-negative integer (since `bin()` works on any integer, but typically we think of binary conversion for non-negative numbers)
   - Actually, looking at the Python `bin()` function, it works on negative numbers too, so let's allow any integer

5. **Post-conditions**:
   - The result should start and end with "db"
   - The middle part should be a valid binary representation
   - The length should be at least 4 (for "db" + at least one binary digit + "db")

6. **Implementation in Dafny**:
   - I need to implement binary conversion from scratch since Dafny doesn't have a built-in `bin()` function
   - I'll need a helper function to convert decimal to binary
   - The helper function will be recursive, so I need a decreases clause

Let me implement this:

```dafny
method decimal_to_binary(decimal: int) returns (result: string)
  ensures |result| >= 4
  ensures result[0..2] == "db"
  ensures result[|result|-2..] == "db"
{
  var binary := decimal_to_binary_helper(decimal);
  result := "db" + binary + "db";
}

function decimal_to_binary_helper(n: int): string


```

I realize the binary conversion needs more nuanced handling. The recursive approach requires careful consideration of positive and negative integers. The implementation must handle zero, positive, and negative numbers differently. Specifically, I'll need to:
- Manage base cases for zero and single-digit positive numbers
- Create a recursive mechanism for converting larger positive numbers
- Handle negative numbers by converting their absolute value and adding a sign
- Ensure the conversion process works correctly for all integer inputs

The recursive strategy involves dividing the number by 2 and tracking the remainders, which will form the binary representation. This approach requires careful management of the recursion to build the binary string correctly.
