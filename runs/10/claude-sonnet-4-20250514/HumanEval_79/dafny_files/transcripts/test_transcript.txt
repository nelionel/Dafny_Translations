=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `decimal_to_binary`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python
def check(candidate):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert candidate(0) == "db0db"
    assert candidate(32) == "db100000db"
    assert candidate(103) == "db1100111db"
    assert candidate(15) == "db1111db", "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method decimal_to_binary(decimal: int) returns (result: string)
  ensures |result| >= 4
  ensures result[0..2] == "db"
  ensures result[|result|-2..] == "db"
{
  var binary := int_to_binary(decimal);
  result := "db" + binary + "db";
}

function int_to_binary(n: int): string
  decreases if n >= 0 then n else -n
{
  if n == 0 then "0"
  else if n > 0 then positive_to_binary(n)
  else "-" + positive_to_binary(-n)
}

function positive_to_binary(n: int): string
  requires n > 0
  decreases n
{
  if n == 1 then "1"
  else positive_to_binary(n / 2) + (if n % 2 == 0 then "0" else "1")
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`decimal_to_binary`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `decimal_to_binary` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `decimal_to_binary` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python tests and the Dafny solution:

1. The method to test is `decimal_to_binary` which takes an int and returns a string
2. The Python tests are:
   - `assert candidate(0) == "db0db"`
   - `assert candidate(32) == "db100000db"`
   - `assert candidate(103) == "db1100111db"`
   - `assert candidate(15) == "db1111db"`
   - `assert True` (this is always true, so it's not really a test)

From the Dafny solution, I can see that:
- `decimal_to_binary` takes `decimal: int` and returns `result: string`
- It calls `int_to_binary` which converts an int to binary string
- Then wraps it with "db" prefix and suffix

For the dummy implementation, I need to create a minimal version that:
- Has the same signature: `method decimal_to_binary(decimal: int) returns (result: string)`
- Returns a default string value
- Should compile

For the tests, I need to convert each assert into a Dafny test method that:
- Calls `decimal_to_binary` with the given input
- Uses `expect` to check the result matches the expected output

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the Python tests and Dafny solution:

1. **Method Analysis:** The method `decimal_to_binary` takes an `int` parameter and returns a `string`.

2. **Test Translation:** I need to convert 4 meaningful assert statements into Dafny test methods (the `assert True` doesn't test anything meaningful).

<dummy>
method decimal_to_binary(decimal: int) returns (result: string)
{
    result := "";
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := decimal_to_binary(0);
    expect result == "db0db";
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := decimal_to_binary(32);
    expect result == "db100000db";
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := decimal_to_binary(103);
    expect result == "db1100111db";
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := decimal_to_binary(15);
    expect result == "db1111db";
}
```
