=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).

Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple


def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """
    # Handle empty list case
    if not numbers:
        return (0, 1)
    
    # Calculate sum and product
    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    total_product = 1
    
    for num in numbers:
        total_product *= num
    
    return (total_sum, total_product)
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
method sum_product(numbers: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  ensures |result| == 2
  ensures |numbers| == 0 ==> result == [0, 1]
  ensures |numbers| > 0 ==> result[0] == sum_of_seq(numbers) && result[1] == product_of_seq(numbers)
{
  if |numbers| == 0 {
    result := [0, 1];
  } else {
    var total_sum := 0;
    var total_product := 1;
    var i := 0;
    
    while i < |numbers|
      invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
      invariant total_sum == sum_of_prefix(numbers, i)
      invariant total_product == product_of_prefix(numbers, i)
    {
      total_sum := total_sum + numbers[i];
      total_product := total_product * numbers[i];
      i := i + 1;
    }
    
    result := [total_sum, total_product];
  }
}

function sum_of_seq(s: seq<int>): int
{
  sum_of_prefix(s, |s|)
}

function product_of_seq(s: seq<int>): int
{
  product_of_prefix(s, |s|)
}

function sum_of_prefix(s: seq<int>, n: int): int
  requires 0 <= n <= |s|
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 then 0
  else s[n-1] + sum_of_prefix(s, n-1)
}

function product_of_prefix(s: seq<int>, n: int): int
  requires 0 <= n <= |s|
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 then 1
  else s[n-1] * product_of_prefix(s, n-1)
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function behavior and compare it with the Dafny specifications.

Python Function Analysis:
1. Takes a List[int] and returns a Tuple[int, int]
2. If the list is empty, returns (0, 1)
3. If the list is non-empty, returns (sum of all elements, product of all elements)

Current Dafny Code:
1. Takes a seq<int> and returns a seq<int>
2. Ensures result has 2 elements
3. If numbers is empty, result is [0, 1]
4. If numbers is non-empty, result[0] is sum and result[1] is product

Looking at this more carefully, the specifications seem correct. Let me check:

1. The method takes a seq<int> (equivalent to List[int])
2. It returns a seq<int> with exactly 2 elements (equivalent to Tuple[int, int])
3. For empty input, it returns [0, 1] which matches the Python (0, 1)
4. For non-empty input, it returns [sum, product] which matches the Python behavior

The helper functions sum_of_seq and product_of_seq are defined correctly using the prefix functions.
The prefix functions are also defined correctly with proper base cases (0 for sum, 1 for product).

The ensures clauses capture:
- The result always has exactly 2 elements
- For empty input, result is [0, 1]
- For non-empty input, result[0] is the sum and result[1] is the product

This seems to correctly capture the Python function's behavior. The method implementation also looks correct with proper loop invariants.

Actually, let me double-check the specifications:
- |result| == 2: ✓ Correct
- |numbers| == 0 ==> result == [0, 1]: ✓ Correct for empty case
- |numbers| > 0 ==> result[0] == sum_of_seq(numbers) && result[1] == product_of_seq(numbers): ✓ Correct for non-empty case
 
The prefix and helper functions align perfectly with the implementation's requirements. I verify their recursive definitions ensure precise mathematical calculations for both sum and product across different sequence lengths.
