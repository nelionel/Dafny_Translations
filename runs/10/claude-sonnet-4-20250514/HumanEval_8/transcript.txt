======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

======USER PROMPT======
from typing import List, Tuple


def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Calculate the sum of all integers in the list
2. Calculate the product of all integers in the list
3. Handle the empty list case where sum should be 0 and product should be 1
4. Return both values as a tuple

```python
from typing import List, Tuple


def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """
    # Handle empty list case
    if not numbers:
        return (0, 1)
    
    # Calculate sum and product
    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    total_product = 1
    
    for num in numbers:
        total_product *= num
    
    return (total_sum, total_product)
```

The implementation:
- First checks if the list is empty and returns (0, 1) as specified
- Uses the built-in `sum()` function to calculate the sum of all numbers
- Uses a loop to calculate the product by multiplying each number (starting with 1 as the identity element for multiplication)
- Returns both values as a tuple
