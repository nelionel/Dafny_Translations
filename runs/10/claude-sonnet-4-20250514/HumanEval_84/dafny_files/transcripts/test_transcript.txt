=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `solve`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python
def check(candidate):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate(1000) == "1", "Error"
    assert candidate(150) == "110", "Error"
    assert candidate(147) == "1100", "Error"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate(333) == "1001", "Error"
    assert candidate(963) == "10010", "Error"


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method solve(N: int) returns (result: string)
  requires 0 <= N <= 10000
  ensures |result| > 0
{
  var digitSum := sumOfDigits(N);
  result := toBinary(digitSum);
}

function sumOfDigits(n: int): int
  requires n >= 0
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 then 0
  else (n % 10) + sumOfDigits(n / 10)
}

function toBinary(n: int): string
  requires n >= 0
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 then "0"
  else if n == 1 then "1"
  else toBinary(n / 2) + (if n % 2 == 0 then "0" else "1")
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`solve`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `solve` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `solve` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python test code and the Dafny solution:

1. **Method to test**: `solve`
2. **Method signature from Dafny solution**: `method solve(N: int) returns (result: string)`
3. **Python tests**:
   - `candidate(1000) == "1"`
   - `candidate(150) == "110"`
   - `candidate(147) == "1100"`
   - `candidate(333) == "1001"`
   - `candidate(963) == "10010"`

Let me understand what the solve method does:
- It takes an integer N
- It calculates the sum of digits of N using `sumOfDigits`
- It converts that sum to binary using `toBinary`
- It returns the binary string

Let me verify a few of these:
- `solve(1000)`: sum of digits = 1+0+0+0 = 1, binary of 1 = "1" ✓
- `solve(150)`: sum of digits = 1+5+0 = 6, binary of 6 = "110" ✓
- `solve(147)`: sum of digits = 1+4+7 = 12, binary of 12 = "1100" ✓
- `solve(333)`: sum of digits = 3+3+3 = 9, binary of 9 = "1001" ✓
- `solve(963)`: sum of digits = 9+6+3 = 18, binary of 18 = "10010" ✓

Now I need to create:
1. A dummy implementation with the same signature
2. Test methods for each assertion

For the dummy implementation, I need:
- `method solve(N: int) returns (result: string)`
- It should return a default string value, like ""

For the tests, I need to create test methods that:


I'll craft test methods to validate the `solve` function by invoking it with specific inputs and using `expect` to verify the outputs match the predefined expectations for each test case.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the Python tests and Dafny solution, I need to test the `solve` method which takes an integer and returns a string.

<dummy>
method solve(N: int) returns (result: string)
{
    result := "";
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := solve(1000);
    expect result == "1";
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := solve(150);
    expect result == "110";
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := solve(147);
    expect result == "1100";
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := solve(333);
    expect result == "1001";
}

method {:test} test_4()
{
    var result := solve(963);
    expect result == "10010";
}
```
