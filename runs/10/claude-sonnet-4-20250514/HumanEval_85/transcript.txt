def add(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..


    Examples:
        add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2 
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Find elements that are at odd indices (positions 1, 3, 5, etc.)
2. Among those elements, select only the even ones
3. Add them up

Let me trace through the example:
- `[4, 2, 6, 7]` has indices 0, 1, 2, 3
- Elements at odd indices: index 1 → 2, index 3 → 7
- Even elements among those: 2 (since 7 is odd)
- Sum: 2

```python
def add(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..


    Examples:
        add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2 
    """
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):  # Start at index 1, step by 2 to get odd indices
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:  # Check if the element is even
            total += lst[i]
    return total
```

The solution:
1. Uses `range(1, len(lst), 2)` to iterate through odd indices only
2. Checks if each element at an odd index is even using `lst[i] % 2 == 0`
3. Adds even elements to the running total
4. Returns the sum
