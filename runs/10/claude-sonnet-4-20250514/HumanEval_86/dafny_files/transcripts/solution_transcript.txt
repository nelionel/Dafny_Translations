You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
    """

def anti_shuffle(s):

    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in

    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:

    """
    if not s:
        return s
    
    # Split the string by spaces to get words
    words = s.split(' ')
    
    # Process each word by sorting its characters
    ordered_words = []
    for word in words:
        # Sort characters in the word by ASCII value
        sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))
        ordered_words.append(sorted_word)
    
    # Join the words back with spaces
    return ' '.join(ordered_words)
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `anti_shuffle`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function first:

1. The function takes a string `s` as input
2. It returns a string where each word is sorted by ASCII value, but the order of words is preserved
3. The function splits by spaces, sorts each word's characters, then joins back with spaces

Let me think about the Dafny implementation:

1. **Types**: Python string maps to Dafny `string`. The function should return a `string`.

2. **Logic analysis**:
   - Split string by spaces -> this is a bit tricky in Dafny since there's no built-in split function
   - Sort characters in each word -> need a sorting function for characters
   - Join back with spaces -> need to construct the result string

3. **Pre/post conditions**:
   - Pre: None really needed, should handle empty strings
   - Post: The result should preserve the structure (same number of words, same spaces)

4. **Implementation approach**:
   - I need to implement string splitting by spaces
   - I need to implement character sorting within each word
   - I need to join the words back

Let me think about how to implement this step by step:

1. I'll need a helper method to split a string by spaces
2. I'll need a helper method to sort characters in a string
3. I'll need a helper method to join strings with spaces

Actually, let me think of a simpler approach. I can iterate through the string character by character, building words, and when I encounter a space, I sort the current word and add it to the result.

Here's my approach:
1. Iterate through each character in the input string
2. Build current word until I hit a space
3. When I hit a space (or reach the end), sort the current word and add it to result
4. Add the space to result (if not at end)
5. Continue until end of string

For sorting characters, I'll need a helper method that takes a string and returns a string with characters sorted.


I'm now starting to implement the method, focusing on handling edge cases and iterating through the string. The implementation will involve carefully tracking the current word and building the result string while sorting characters when a word is complete.

The sorting mechanism uses a sequence-based approach, converting the string to a character sequence and applying an insertion sort algorithm. This allows for precise character manipulation and ordering.

The method systematically processes each character, building words and sorting them when encountering word boundaries. By tracking the current index and managing word construction, the anti-shuffle algorithm ensures each word is alphabetically sorted while maintaining the original string's structure.

The insertion process carefully places each character in its correct position within the sorted sequence, using a linear search to find the appropriate insertion point. This ensures a stable, predictable sorting mechanism that preserves the relative order of equal elements.

I'll track the insertion index precisely, comparing each character and shifting elements as needed to maintain the sorted property. The method systematically builds the sorted sequence by inserting characters one at a time with minimal computational overhead.

<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Types**: The function takes a string and returns a string. In Dafny, this maps to `string -> string`.

2. **Logic**: 
   - Split string by spaces to get individual words
   - Sort characters within each word by ASCII value
   - Join words back with spaces, preserving the original structure

3. **Implementation strategy**:
   - I need to implement string splitting by spaces
   - I need to sort characters within each word
   - I need to reconstruct the result string

4. **Approach**: Since Dafny doesn't have built-in string split/join, I'll:
   - Iterate through the string character by character
   - Build current word until hitting a space
   - When hitting a space (or end), sort the current word and add to result
   - Continue until the entire string is processed

5. **Helper methods needed**:
   - Method to sort characters in a string
   - Character insertion sort for the sorting logic

Let me implement this step by step with proper invariants and termination conditions.
