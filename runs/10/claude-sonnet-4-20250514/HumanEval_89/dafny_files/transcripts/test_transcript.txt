=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `encrypt`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python
def check(candidate):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert candidate('hi') == 'lm', "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate('asdfghjkl') == 'ewhjklnop', "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate('gf') == 'kj', "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate('et') == 'ix', "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"

    assert candidate('faewfawefaewg')=='jeiajeaijeiak', "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate('hellomyfriend')=='lippsqcjvmirh', "This prints if this assert fails 2 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate('dxzdlmnilfuhmilufhlihufnmlimnufhlimnufhfucufh')=='hbdhpqrmpjylqmpyjlpmlyjrqpmqryjlpmqryjljygyjl', "This prints if this assert fails 3 (good for debugging!)"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert candidate('a')=='e', "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method encrypt(s: string) returns (result: string)
    ensures |result| == |s|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> 
        (('a' <= s[i] && s[i] <= 'z') ==> result[i] == (((s[i] as int - 'a' as int + 4) % 26) + 'a' as int) as char) &&
        (('A' <= s[i] && s[i] <= 'Z') ==> result[i] == (((s[i] as int - 'A' as int + 4) % 26) + 'A' as int) as char) &&
        (!(('a' <= s[i] && s[i] <= 'z') || ('A' <= s[i] && s[i] <= 'Z')) ==> result[i] == s[i])
{
    result := "";
    var i := 0;
    
    while i < |s|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
        invariant |result| == i
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> 
            (('a' <= s[j] && s[j] <= 'z') ==> result[j] == (((s[j] as int - 'a' as int + 4) % 26) + 'a' as int) as char) &&
            (('A' <= s[j] && s[j] <= 'Z') ==> result[j] == (((s[j] as int - 'A' as int + 4) % 26) + 'A' as int) as char) &&
            (!(('a' <= s[j] && s[j] <= 'z') || ('A' <= s[j] && s[j] <= 'Z')) ==> result[j] == s[j])
        decreases |s| - i
    {
        var c := s[i];
        var shifted: char;
        
        if 'a' <= c && c <= 'z' {
            // Shift lowercase letters
            shifted := (((c as int - 'a' as int + 4) % 26) + 'a' as int) as char;
        } else if 'A' <= c && c <= 'Z' {
            // Shift uppercase letters  
            shifted := (((c as int - 'A' as int + 4) % 26) + 'A' as int) as char;
        } else {
            // Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged
            shifted := c;
        }
        
        result := result + [shifted];
        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`encrypt`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `encrypt` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `encrypt` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the test code and Dafny solution:

1. The method to test is `encrypt` which takes a string and returns a string
2. From the Python tests, I can see the expected behavior:
   - 'hi' should become 'lm'
   - 'asdfghjkl' should become 'ewhjklnop'
   - 'gf' should become 'kj'
   - 'et' should become 'ix'
   - 'faewfawefaewg' should become 'jeiajeaijeiak'
   - 'hellomyfriend' should become 'lippsqcjvmirh'
   - 'dxzdlmnilfuhmilufhlihufnmlimnufhlimnufhfucufh' should become 'hbdhpqrmpjylqmpyjlpmlyjrqpmqryjlpmqryjljygyjl'
   - 'a' should become 'e'

Looking at the Dafny solution, it shifts each letter by 4 positions in the alphabet (Caesar cipher with shift 4).

For the dummy implementation, I need to create a method with the same signature that returns an empty string.

For the tests, I need to convert each assert statement to a Dafny test method.

--- RESPONSE ---
<dummy>
method encrypt(s: string) returns (result: string)
{
    result := "";
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := encrypt("hi");
    expect result == "lm";
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := encrypt("asdfghjkl");
    expect result == "ewhjklnop";
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := encrypt("gf");
    expect result == "kj";
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := encrypt("et");
    expect result == "ix";
}

method {:test} test_4()
{
    var result := encrypt("faewfawefaewg");
    expect result == "jeiajeaijeiak";
}

method {:test} test_5()
{
    var result := encrypt("hellomyfriend");
    expect result == "lippsqcjvmirh";
}

method {:test} test_6()
{
    var result := encrypt("dxzdlmnilfuhmilufhlihufnmlimnufhlimnufhfucufh");
    expect result == "hbdhpqrmpjylqmpyjlpmlyjrqpmqryjlpmqryjljygyjl";
}

method {:test} test_7()
{
    var result := encrypt("a");
    expect result == "e";
}
```
