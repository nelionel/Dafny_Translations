You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def next_smallest(lst):
    """
    You are given a list of integers.
    Write a function next_smallest() that returns the 2nd smallest element of the list.
    Return None if there is no such element.
    
    next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 2
    next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]) == 2
    next_smallest([]) == None
    next_smallest([1, 1]) == None
    """

def next_smallest(lst):
    """
    You are given a list of integers.
    Write a function next_smallest() that returns the 2nd smallest element of the list.
    Return None if there is no such element.
    
    next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 2
    next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]) == 2
    next_smallest([]) == None
    next_smallest([1, 1]) == None
    """
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None
    
    # Remove duplicates and sort
    unique_sorted = sorted(set(lst))
    
    # If we have less than 2 unique elements, return None
    if len(unique_sorted) < 2:
        return None
    
    # Return the second smallest unique element
    return unique_sorted[1]
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `next_smallest`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let's analyze the Python function:

1. It takes a list of integers and returns the 2nd smallest element or None if it doesn't exist.
2. It first checks if the list has less than 2 elements, returning None.
3. It removes duplicates using `set()` and sorts the result.
4. If the unique sorted list has less than 2 elements, it returns None.
5. Otherwise, it returns the second element of the unique sorted list (index 1).

For the Dafny translation:
- The input will be `seq<int>` instead of `list`.
- Since we can't return `None`, we need to handle this case. The problem statement says to use a basic type, so I'll return `-1` to indicate "no such element" (this is a common convention).
- We need to implement duplicate removal and sorting.
- We need to ensure the method is verifiable with proper pre/post conditions.

The logic:
1. If sequence length < 2, return -1
2. Remove duplicates from the sequence
3. Sort the unique elements
4. If unique elements < 2, return -1
5. Return the second smallest (index 1)

For duplicate removal, I'll need a helper function. For sorting, I can implement a simple sorting algorithm.

Let me think about the specifications:
- `requires`: None specific, the function should work for any sequence
- `ensures`: The result should be either -1 (if no second smallest exists) or the actual second smallest unique element

I need helper functions:
1. `remove_duplicates` - to remove duplicates from a sequence
2. `sort_sequence` - to sort a sequence
3. Maybe a function to check if an element is the second smallest

Actually, let me think about this more systematically. I need to:
1. Create a sequence of unique elements
2. Sort that sequence  
3. Return the second element if it exists

For the unique elements, I can iterate through and only add elements that aren't already in the result.


I'll implement a straightforward sorting approach using a classic algorithm that's easy to verify. Bubble sort or insertion sort would work well in this context, providing a simple and transparent method for ordering the unique elements efficiently.

--- RESPONSE ---
<thinking>
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. **Types**: The input is a list of integers, which maps to `seq<int>` in Dafny. The return type is either an integer or None, but since Dafny requires basic types, I'll return `-1` to indicate "no such element".

2. **Logic**: 
   - Check if list has fewer than 2 elements → return None (or -1 in Dafny)
   - Remove duplicates and sort
   - If fewer than 2 unique elements → return None (or -1 in Dafny)  
   - Otherwise return the second element of the sorted unique list

3. **Pre/post conditions**:
   - `requires`: No specific requirements, should work for any sequence
   - `ensures`: Result is either -1 (no second smallest exists) or the actual second smallest unique element

4. **Helper functions needed**:
   - Function to remove duplicates from a sequence
   - Function to sort a sequence
   - These will involve loops, so I need proper invariants and termination proofs

5. **Termination**: The main operations (duplicate removal, sorting) will operate on sequences, so termination metrics will be sequence lengths.
