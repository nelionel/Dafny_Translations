======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

======USER PROMPT======

def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1
    """


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Split the string into sentences using '.', '?', or '!' as delimiters
2. For each sentence, check if it starts with the word "I"
3. Count how many sentences start with "I"

Let me implement this step by step:

```python
def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1
    """
    import re
    
    # Split the string by sentence delimiters (., ?, !)
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]', S)
    
    boredom_count = 0
    
    for sentence in sentences:
        # Strip whitespace and check if sentence is not empty
        sentence = sentence.strip()
        if sentence:
            # Split into words and check if first word is "I"
            words = sentence.split()
            if words and words[0] == "I":
                boredom_count += 1
    
    return boredom_count
```

The solution works as follows:

1. Use `re.split(r'[.?!]', S)` to split the string into sentences using any of the three delimiters
2. Iterate through each sentence
3. Strip whitespace from each sentence and check if it's not empty
4. Split the sentence into words and check if the first word is exactly "I"
5. Count the number of sentences that start with "I"

This handles edge cases like:
- Empty sentences after splitting
- Multiple spaces between words
- Sentences that don't start with "I"
- The word "I" appearing later in the sentence (which shouldn't count)
