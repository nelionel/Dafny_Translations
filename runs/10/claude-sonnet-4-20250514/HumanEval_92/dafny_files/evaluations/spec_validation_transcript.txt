=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny specifications. Your task is to analyze whether Dafny method specifications properly describe the behavior of the corresponding Python function.

You will be given:
1. A Python function with its behavior
2. A Dafny method translation with specifications (requires, ensures clauses)

Your job is to determine if the Dafny specifications fully and accurately capture the Python function's behavior. If not, you should improve the specifications.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" - if the specifications correctly describe the function
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" - if the specifications need improvement

After this phrase, provide the complete Dafny code (either unchanged or with improved specifications).



=============== USER ===============
Please analyze whether the Dafny specifications properly describe the Python function behavior.

**Python Function:**
```python
def any_int(x, y, z):
    '''
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    
    Examples
    any_int(5, 2, 7) ➞ True
    
    any_int(3, 2, 2) ➞ False

    any_int(3, -2, 1) ➞ True
    
    any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2) ➞ False
    '''
    
    # Check if all numbers are integers
    if not (isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int) and isinstance(z, int)):
        return False
    
    # Check if any number equals the sum of the other two
    if x == y + z or y == x + z or z == x + y:
        return True
    
    return False
```

**Current Dafny Code:**
```dafny
method any_int(x: real, y: real, z: real) returns (result: bool)
{
    // Check if all numbers are integers
    if !(x as int as real == x && y as int as real == y && z as int as real == z) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check if any number equals the sum of the other two
    if x == y + z || y == x + z || z == x + y {
        return true;
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

**Analysis Task:**
1. Compare the Python function's behavior with the Dafny specifications
2. Check if the `requires` clauses capture all preconditions
3. Check if the `ensures` clauses capture all postconditions and behavior
4. Verify that the specifications fully describe what the function does

**Response Format:**
Start with exactly one of these phrases:
- "THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS" (if specifications are adequate)
- "THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC" (if specifications need improvement)

Then provide the complete Dafny code. If improving specifications:
- Add missing `requires` clauses for preconditions
- Add missing `ensures` clauses for postconditions
- Ensure specifications capture the function's complete behavior
- Preserve the existing method implementation unchanged

Let me analyze the Python function and the Dafny code to see if the specifications properly describe the behavior.

Looking at the Python function:
1. It takes 3 parameters (x, y, z)
2. It returns True if:
   - All three numbers are integers AND
   - One of the numbers equals the sum of the other two
3. It returns False otherwise

Now looking at the Dafny code:
- The method signature takes 3 real parameters and returns a bool
- The implementation checks if all numbers are integers using `x as int as real == x` etc.
- Then it checks if any number equals the sum of the other two
- Returns true if the sum condition is met, false otherwise

However, I notice that the Dafny code has NO specifications (no requires or ensures clauses). The behavior is only captured in the implementation, but there are no formal specifications that describe:
1. What the method requires from its inputs
2. What the method guarantees about its output

The specifications should capture:
- The postcondition should describe when the result is true vs false
- It should specify that result is true iff all inputs are integers AND one equals the sum of the other two
- It should specify that result is false otherwise

Since there are no requires or ensures clauses at all, this definitely needs improvement.

THE SCRIPT HAD NOT A PROPER SPEC

```dafny
method any_int(x: real, y: real, z: real) returns (result: bool)
    ensures result == (
        (x as int as real == x && y as int as real == y && z as int as real == z) &&
        (x == y + z || y == x + z || z == x + y)
    )
{
    // Check if all numbers are integers
    if !(x as int as real == x && y as int as real == y && z as int as real == z) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check if any number equals the sum of the other two
    if x == y + z || y == x + z || z == x + y {
        return true;
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

This is attempt 2 to improve the specifications. Please analyze the current version and improve it further if needed.

Let me analyze the Python function and the current Dafny code to see if the specifications properly capture the behavior.

**Python Function Behavior:**
1. Takes 3 numbers (x, y, z)
2. Returns True if:
   - All numbers are integers AND
   - One of the numbers equals the sum of the other two (x == y + z OR y == x + z OR z == x + y)
3. Returns False otherwise

**Current Dafny Code Analysis:**
The method signature uses `real` type for all parameters, which makes sense since we need to check if they are integers.

The ensures clause is:
```dafny
ensures result == (
    (x as int as real == x && y as int as real == y && z as int as real == z) &&
    (x == y + z || y == x + z || z == x + y)
)
```

This says:
- result is true if and only if:
  - All three numbers are integers (x as int as real == x checks if x is an integer value)
  - AND one of the sum conditions holds

Let me check if this correctly captures the Python behavior:

1. **Integer check**: `x as int as real == x` - this checks if x is an integer value. In Dafny, when you cast a real to int and back to real, you get the same value only if the original real was already an integer. This seems correct.

2. **Sum check**: `(x == y + z || y == x + z || z == x + y)` - this checks if any number equals the sum of the other two. This matches the Python logic.

3. **Return logic**: The specification says result is true if and only if both conditions are met, and false otherwise. This matches the Python function which returns True only when both conditions are satisfied.

Looking at the implementation:
- It first checks if all numbers are integers, returns false if not
- Then checks the sum conditions, returns true if any match


- Returns false otherwise

The implementation matches the specification.

The specification seems to correctly capture the Python function's behavior. The ensures clause properly describes when the function returns true (both integer condition and sum condition must be met) and when it returns false (otherwise).

I've verified the implementation thoroughly and confirmed its alignment with the original requirements. The Dafny specification precisely captures the intended logic of checking integer values and sum relationships between the three input numbers.

--- RESPONSE ---
THE SCRIPT HAS PROPER SPECS

```dafny
method any_int(x: real, y: real, z: real) returns (result: bool)
    ensures result == (
        (x as int as real == x && y as int as real == y && z as int as real == z) &&
        (x == y + z || y == x + z || z == x + y)
    )
{
    // Check if all numbers are integers
    if !(x as int as real == x && y as int as real == y && z as int as real == z) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check if any number equals the sum of the other two
    if x == y + z || y == x + z || z == x + y {
        return true;
    }
    
    return false;
}
```
