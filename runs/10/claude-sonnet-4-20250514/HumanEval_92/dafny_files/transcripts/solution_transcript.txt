=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def any_int(x, y, z):
    '''
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    
    Examples
    any_int(5, 2, 7) ➞ True
    
    any_int(3, 2, 2) ➞ False

    any_int(3, -2, 1) ➞ True
    
    any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2) ➞ False
  

    
    '''

def any_int(x, y, z):
    '''
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    
    Examples
    any_int(5, 2, 7) ➞ True
    
    any_int(3, 2, 2) ➞ False

    any_int(3, -2, 1) ➞ True
    
    any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2) ➞ False
    '''
    
    # Check if all numbers are integers
    if not (isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int) and isinstance(z, int)):
        return False
    
    # Check if any number equals the sum of the other two
    if x == y + z or y == x + z or z == x + y:
        return True
    
    return False
```

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `any_int`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python function:

1. The function takes 3 numbers and returns a boolean
2. The function first checks if all three inputs are integers
3. If they are all integers, it checks if any one of them equals the sum of the other two
4. Returns true if both conditions are met, false otherwise

In Dafny, I need to handle the type checking differently since Dafny is statically typed. In Python, the function can receive any type of input (int, float, string, etc.) and uses `isinstance` to check if they are integers. In Dafny, I have a few options:

1. Use `real` type for all inputs and check if they are integers (i.e., have no fractional part)
2. Use a union type or variant type
3. Use `int` type directly

Looking at the examples:
- `any_int(5, 2, 7) ➞ True` - all integers, 5 = 2 + 3? No, 7 = 5 + 2? Yes
- `any_int(3, 2, 2) ➞ False` - all integers, but 3 ≠ 2+2, 2 ≠ 3+2, 2 ≠ 3+2
- `any_int(3, -2, 1) ➞ True` - all integers, 3 = -2 + 1? No, wait... 3 = -2 + 5? No... Let me check: 3 = -2 + 1? That's 3 = -1, false. -2 = 3 + 1? That's -2 = 4, false. 1 = 3 + (-2)? That's 1 = 1, true!
- `any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2) ➞ False` - not all integers
 
I'll implement integer validation using Dafny's real type with precise integer checking. The approach involves verifying each number is truly an integer by comparing it to its integer conversion. I'll create a method that first confirms all inputs are whole numbers, then checks the sum condition across all possible combinations. This ensures I capture the exact logic of the original Python function while adapting to Dafny's type system.

The key steps will involve:
1. Confirming each input is an integer
2. Checking sum relationships between the three numbers
3. Returning a boolean result based on these conditions

The implementation will use type conversion and equality checks to determine integer status and validate the mathematical relationship.

I'll verify each number's integer nature by converting to int and back, which reveals potential precision challenges. The conversion method might introduce subtle numerical representation complexities that require careful handling.

A more direct strategy involves examining whether the integer conversion preserves the original real number's value, which provides a straightforward integer validation mechanism.

Looking at the Python function:

1. It takes 3 numbers of any type and returns a boolean
2. First checks if all inputs are integers using `isinstance`
3. If all are integers, checks if any one equals the sum of the other two
4. Returns true if both conditions are met, false otherwise

For Dafny translation:
- Since Python can receive any type, I'll use `real` type in Dafny to handle both integers and floats
- To check if a real number is an integer, I can verify if `x as int as real == x`
- The logic is straightforward: check integer condition first, then check sum condition
- No loops or recursion, so no need for invariants or decreases clauses
- Pre-conditions: none needed (can handle any real numbers)
- Post-conditions: could specify the exact logic, but not strictly necessary for this simple function

```dafny
method any_int(x: real, y: real, z: real) returns (result: bool)
{
    // Check if all numbers are integers
    if !(x as int as real == x && y as int as real == y && z as int as real == z) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check if any number equals the sum of the other two
    if x == y + z || y == x + z || z == x + y {
        return true;
    }
    
    return false;
}
```
