You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python code to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate the provided Python function into a Dafny method that is both verifiable and compilable. Pay close attention to types, specifications, and providing concrete implementations for all methods.



=============== USER ===============
I will provide you with a Python function and its documentation. Please translate the Python function into a Dafny method.

**Python Function and Documentation:**
```python

def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
    for example:

    count_up_to(11) => [2,3,5,7]
    count_up_to(0) => []
    count_up_to(20) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]

        # Check odd divisors up to sqrt(num)
        for i in range(3, int(num**0.5) + 1, 2):

**Your Task:**
1.  **Reasoning (in a <thinking> block):**
    *   Analyze the Python code and its types. How will you map Python types (like lists of floats) to Dafny types (like `seq<real>`)?
    *   Analyze the function's logic. What are the pre-conditions (`requires`) and post-conditions (`ensures`)?
    *   Identify any loops and determine their invariants.
    *   Think about termination conditions for any recursive calls or loops.
2.  **Dafny Implementation (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):**
    *   Write the complete Dafny method, including its signature, `requires` clauses, `ensures` clauses, and the method body.
    *   **The return type of the main method must be a basic Dafny type.** Use `int`, `real`, `bool`, `string`, or a sequence of these types (e.g., `seq<int>`). Do not use custom `datatype`s in the return signature. If the Python code implies an optional return (e.g. returning `None`), you should return a sensible default for the basic type instead (e.g. `false`, `-1`, or an empty sequence `[]`).
    *   The Dafny method name must be exactly the same as the Python function name: `count_up_to`. Do not change the casing.
    *   **All methods must have a concrete implementation (a body).** The `{:axiom}` attribute is forbidden for defining standard functions. However, if the problem's solution relies on an unproven mathematical conjecture (e.g., the Goldbach Conjecture, P vs NP), you may state the conjecture as an `axiom`. If you do so, you **must** include a comment identifying the conjecture (e.g., `// Axiom for the Twin Prime Conjecture`). Do not use axioms to avoid implementing solvable algorithms.
    *   **Provide explicit termination proofs.** For any recursive function, you must include a `decreases` clause. Do **not** use `decreases *`. For functions that operate on a sequence, the termination metric is almost always the length of the sequence (e.g., `decreases my_sequence`). For functions on integers, it is the integer itself (e.g., `decreases n`).
    *   **Do not use Dafny reserved keywords as variable names.** Avoid names like: `abstract, allocated, as, assert, assume, bool, break, by, calc, case, char, class, codatatype, const, constructor, datatype, decreases, else, ensures, exists, export, extends, false, forall, fresh, function, ghost, if, imap, import, in, include, int, invariant, is, iset, iterator, label, lemma, map, match, method, modifies, modify, module, multiset, nameonly, nat, new, newtype, null, object, object?, old, opened, ORDINAL, predicate, print, provides,reads, real, refines, requires, return, returns, reveal, reveals, seq, set, static, string, then, this, trait, true, twostate, type, unchanged, var, while, witness, yield, yields`. For example, instead of `var array`, use `var arr`.

--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python code:

1. The function `count_up_to(n)` takes a non-negative integer and returns a list of prime numbers less than n.
2. It has a helper function `is_prime(num)` that checks if a number is prime.
3. The main function iterates from 2 to n-1 and checks if each number is prime, adding it to the result list if it is.

For the Dafny translation:

1. **Types**: The function takes an `int` and returns a `seq<int>` (sequence of integers).

2. **Preconditions**: The function should require that `n >= 0` (non-negative integer).

3. **Postconditions**: 
   - The result should be a sequence of prime numbers
   - All numbers in the result should be less than n
   - All numbers in the result should be >= 2 (since primes start from 2)
   - The sequence should be in ascending order

4. **Helper function**: I need to implement `is_prime` as a Dafny function.

5. **Loop invariants**: For the main loop that iterates from 2 to n-1:
   - The result contains only prime numbers
   - All numbers in the result are less than the current iteration variable
   - The result is in ascending order

6. **Termination**: The loop clearly terminates since it has a fixed range from 2 to n-1.

Let me implement this step by step:

First, the `is_prime` function:
- Takes an integer and returns a boolean
- Should handle cases: num < 2 (false), num == 2 (true), even numbers > 2 (false)
- For odd numbers > 2, check divisibility by odd numbers from 3 to sqrt(num)

For the main function:
- Initialize an empty sequence
- Loop from 2 to n-1


- For each number, if it's prime, add it to the sequence
- Return the sequence

I'll systematically build the implementation by checking each number in the range, identifying prime numbers through careful divisibility testing. The goal is to create a precise method for generating a sequence of primes efficiently.
