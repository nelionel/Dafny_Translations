=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `count_up_to`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python
def check(candidate):

    assert candidate(5) == [2,3]
    assert candidate(6) == [2,3,5]
    assert candidate(7) == [2,3,5]
    assert candidate(10) == [2,3,5,7]
    assert candidate(0) == []
    assert candidate(22) == [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]
    assert candidate(1) == []
    assert candidate(18) == [2,3,5,7,11,13,17]
    assert candidate(47) == [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43]
    assert candidate(101) == [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
function is_prime(num: int): bool
  requires num >= 0
{
  if num < 2 then false
  else if num == 2 then true
  else if num % 2 == 0 then false
  else is_prime_odd_helper(num, 3)
}

function is_prime_odd_helper(num: int, divisor: int): bool
  requires num >= 3
  requires divisor >= 3
  requires divisor % 2 == 1
  decreases num - divisor
{
  if divisor * divisor > num then true
  else if num % divisor == 0 then false
  else is_prime_odd_helper(num, divisor + 2)
}

method count_up_to(n: int) returns (result: seq<int>)
  requires n >= 0
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> is_prime(result[i])
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] < n
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] >= 2
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |result| ==> result[i] < result[j]
{
  result := [];
  
  if n <= 2 {
    return;
  }
  
  var i := 2;
  while i < n
    invariant 2 <= i <= n
    invariant forall k :: 0 <= k < |result| ==> is_prime(result[k])
    invariant forall k :: 0 <= k < |result| ==> result[k] < i
    invariant forall k :: 0 <= k < |result| ==> result[k] >= 2
    invariant forall j, k :: 0 <= j < k < |result| ==> result[j] < result[k]
    invariant forall p :: 2 <= p < i && is_prime(p) ==> p in result
  {
    if is_prime(i) {
      result := result + [i];
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`count_up_to`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `count_up_to` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `count_up_to` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the task:

1. The Dafny method to test is `count_up_to`
2. Looking at the Dafny solution, the signature is:
   `method count_up_to(n: int) returns (result: seq<int>)`

3. The Python tests are:
   - `candidate(5) == [2,3]`
   - `candidate(6) == [2,3,5]`
   - `candidate(7) == [2,3,5]`
   - `candidate(10) == [2,3,5,7]`
   - `candidate(0) == []`
   - `candidate(22) == [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]`
   - `candidate(1) == []`
   - `candidate(18) == [2,3,5,7,11,13,17]`
   - `candidate(47) == [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43]`
   - `candidate(101) == [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]`

So I need to create a dummy implementation that returns a `seq<int>` and then create test methods for each assertion.

Let me create the dummy first:
```dafny
method count_up_to(n: int) returns (result: seq<int>)
{
    result := [];
}
```

But wait, I also need the helper functions for the dummy to compile. Let me check what the actual solution uses... it uses `is_prime` and `is_prime_odd_helper`. 

I'll craft a minimal implementation for testing. The dummy method will return an empty sequence, which provides a baseline for initial test cases. I'll prepare test methods to verify the method's behavior across different input scenarios, focusing on edge cases and typical inputs from the Python test suite.

The key is to create a simple placeholder that allows compilation and initial testing, setting the groundwork for a more complex implementation later. I'll focus on creating test methods that cover the various input ranges, from zero to larger numbers like 101.

--- RESPONSE ---
Looking at the Dafny solution, I can see that `count_up_to` is a method that takes an `int` parameter and returns a `seq<int>`.

<dummy>
method count_up_to(n: int) returns (result: seq<int>)
{
    result := [];
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := count_up_to(5);
    expect result == [2,3];
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := count_up_to(6);
    expect result == [2,3,5];
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := count_up_to(7);
    expect result == [2,3,5];
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := count_up_to(10);
    expect result == [2,3,5,7];
}

method {:test} test_4()
{
    var result := count_up_to(0);
    expect result == [];
}

method {:test} test_5()
{
    var result := count_up_to(22);
    expect result == [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19];
}

method {:test} test_6()
{
    var result := count_up_to(1);
    expect result == [];
}

method {:test} test_7()
{
    var result := count_up_to(18);
    expect result == [2,3,5,7,11,13,17];
}

method {:test} test_8()
{
    var result := count_up_to(47);
    expect result == [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43];
}

method {:test} test_9()
{
    var result := count_up_to(101);
    expect result == [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97];
}
```
