=============== SYSTEM ===============
You are an expert programmer specializing in translating Python tests to the Dafny verification language. Your task is to translate Python `assert` statements into Dafny test methods and provide a minimal dummy implementation for compilation checking.



=============== USER ===============
I need you to translate Python test assertions into Dafny test methods.

**The Method to Test:**
The Dafny method you need to test is named `count_upper`.

**Python Test Code:**
```python
def check(candidate):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert candidate('aBCdEf')  == 1
    assert candidate('abcdefg') == 0
    assert candidate('dBBE') == 0
    assert candidate('B')  == 0
    assert candidate('U')  == 1
    assert candidate('') == 0
    assert candidate('EEEE') == 2

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True


```

**Dafny Solution Code (that these tests should test):**
```dafny
method count_upper(s: string) returns (count: int)
    ensures count >= 0
    ensures count <= (|s| + 1) / 2  // at most the number of even indices
{
    count := 0;
    var i := 0;
    
    while i < |s|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
        invariant i % 2 == 0  // i is always even
        invariant count >= 0
        invariant count <= i / 2  // count doesn't exceed number of even indices processed so far
        decreases |s| - i
    {
        if is_uppercase_vowel(s[i]) {
            count := count + 1;
        }
        i := i + 2;
    }
}

predicate is_uppercase_vowel(c: char)
{
    c == 'A' || c == 'E' || c == 'I' || c == 'O' || c == 'U'
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. **Analyze the tests and solution:**
   - Note the exact name (`count_upper`) and signature of the Dafny method from the provided solution code.

2. **Create a minimal dummy implementation** (in a `<dummy>` block):
   - Create a dummy version of the `count_upper` Dafny method.
   - The dummy should have the same signature as the method in the full Dafny solution and return appropriate default values (0 for int, false for bool, [] for sequences, etc.).
   - This dummy is ONLY for validating that the test code compiles correctly.

3. **Translate the tests** (in a ```dafny ... ``` block):
   - For each `assert` statement in the Python code, create a Dafny test method with `{:test}` attribute.
   - **All generated test methods must have a complete body and be runnable.**
   - Name them `test_0`, `test_1`, etc.
   - Convert scientific notation (e.g., 1e-6) to decimal form (e.g., 0.000001).
   - Each test method should:
     a. Call the `count_upper` Dafny method and assign the result to a variable.
     b. Use `expect` to check if the result matches the expected value.

**Example:** If Python has `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the method to test is `add`, and the Dafny solution has `function add(a: int, b: int): int`, then:
<dummy>
function add(a: int, b: int): int
{
    0
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := add(2, 3);
    expect result == 5;
}
```



=============== ASSISTANT ===============
--- THINKING ---
Let me analyze the Python test code and the Dafny solution:

1. The Dafny method is named `count_upper` and takes a string parameter and returns an int.
2. From the solution, I can see that the method signature is:
   `method count_upper(s: string) returns (count: int)`

3. Looking at the Python tests:
   - `candidate('aBCdEf')  == 1`
   - `candidate('abcdefg') == 0`
   - `candidate('dBBE') == 0`
   - `candidate('B')  == 0`
   - `candidate('U')  == 1`
   - `candidate('') == 0`
   - `candidate('EEEE') == 2`
   - The last `assert True` doesn't need a test method since it's always true.

4. For the dummy implementation, I need to create a method with the same signature that returns a default value (0 for int).

5. For each test, I need to create a method with `{:test}` attribute that calls `count_upper` and uses `expect` to check the result.

Let me create the dummy and tests:

--- RESPONSE ---
<dummy>
method count_upper(s: string) returns (count: int)
{
    count := 0;
}

predicate is_uppercase_vowel(c: char)
{
    false
}
</dummy>

```dafny
method {:test} test_0()
{
    var result := count_upper("aBCdEf");
    expect result == 1;
}

method {:test} test_1()
{
    var result := count_upper("abcdefg");
    expect result == 0;
}

method {:test} test_2()
{
    var result := count_upper("dBBE");
    expect result == 0;
}

method {:test} test_3()
{
    var result := count_upper("B");
    expect result == 0;
}

method {:test} test_4()
{
    var result := count_upper("U");
    expect result == 1;
}

method {:test} test_5()
{
    var result := count_upper("");
    expect result == 0;
}

method {:test} test_6()
{
    var result := count_upper("EEEE");
    expect result == 2;
}
```
