You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def rounded_avg(n, m):
    """You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the
    average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). 
    Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.
    If n is greater than m, return -1.
    Example:
    rounded_avg(1, 5) => "0b11"
    rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1
    rounded_avg(10, 20) => "0b1111"
    rounded_avg(20, 33) => "0b11010"
    """

======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Check if n > m, and return -1 if so
2. Calculate the average of integers from n to m (inclusive)
3. Round to the nearest integer
4. Convert to binary format

Let me trace through the examples:
- `rounded_avg(1, 5)`: average of 1,2,3,4,5 = 15/5 = 3, binary of 3 is "0b11"
- `rounded_avg(7, 5)`: 7 > 5, so return -1
- `rounded_avg(10, 20)`: average of 10 through 20 = 165/11 = 15, binary of 15 is "0b1111"
- `rounded_avg(20, 33)`: average of 20 through 33 = 371/14 â‰ˆ 26.5, rounded = 26, binary of 26 is "0b11010"

```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    """You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the
    average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). 
    Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.
    If n is greater than m, return -1.
    Example:
    rounded_avg(1, 5) => "0b11"
    rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1
    rounded_avg(10, 20) => "0b1111"
    rounded_avg(20, 33) => "0b11010"
    """
    if n > m:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate the sum of integers from n to m using arithmetic sequence formula
    # Sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2
    # Number of terms = m - n + 1
    num_terms = m - n + 1
    total_sum = num_terms * (n + m) // 2
    
    # Calculate average and round to nearest integer
    average = total_sum / num_terms
    rounded_average = round(average)
    
    # Convert to binary
    return bin(rounded_average)
