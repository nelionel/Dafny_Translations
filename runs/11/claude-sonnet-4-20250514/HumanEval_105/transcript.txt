======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def by_length(arr):

    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,
    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from
    "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine".

    For example:
      arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]

      If the array is empty, return an empty array:
      arr = []
      return []
    
      If the array has any strange number ignore it:

            -> sort arr -> [-1, 1, 55]

======THINKING======


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Filter the array to keep only integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive)
2. Sort the filtered integers
3. Reverse the sorted array
4. Convert each digit to its corresponding word name

Let me trace through the examples:
- Example 1: [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3] → filter valid digits → [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3] → sort → [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8] → reverse → [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1] → convert to words
- Example 2: [] → return []
- Example 3: [1, -1, 55] → filter valid digits → [1] → sort → [1] → reverse → [1] → convert to words → ['One']
