======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def f(n):
    """ Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,
    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
    i starts from 1.
    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
    Example:
    f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
    """

======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Create a list of size n
2. For each index i (starting from 1), determine if i is even or odd
3. If i is even: calculate factorial of i
4. If i is odd: calculate sum from 1 to i
5. Store the result at index i-1 (since list indices start from 0)

Let me trace through the example:
- f(5) should return [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
- i=1 (odd): sum 1 to 1 = 1
- i=2 (even): factorial of 2 = 2
- i=3 (odd): sum 1 to 3 = 6
- i=4 (even): factorial of 4 = 24
- i=5 (odd): sum 1 to 5 = 15

```python
def f(n):
    """ Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,
    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
    i starts from 1.
    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
    Example:
    f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
    """
    result = []
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:  # i is even
            # Calculate factorial of i
            factorial = 1
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                factorial *= j
            result.append(factorial)
        else:  # i is odd
            # Calculate sum from 1 to i
            sum_val = sum(range(1, i + 1))
            result.append(sum_val)
    
    return result
