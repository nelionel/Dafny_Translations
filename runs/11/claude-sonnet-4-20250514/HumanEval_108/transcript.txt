You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def count_nums(arr):

======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. For each number in the array, calculate the sum of its digits
2. Handle negative numbers specially - the first digit keeps the negative sign, rest are positive
3. Count how many numbers have a digit sum > 0

Let me trace through the examples:
- `[]` → 0 (empty array)
- `[-1, 11, -11]` → 1 
  - -1: digit sum = -1 (≤ 0)
  - 11: digit sum = 1 + 1 = 2 (> 0) ✓
  - -11: digit sum = -1 + 1 = 0 (≤ 0)
- `[1, 1, 2]` → 3 (all positive numbers have digit sum > 0)

```python

    """
