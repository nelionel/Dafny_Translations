======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

    """ Input are two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    Perform binary XOR on these inputs and return result also as a string.

======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Take two binary strings as input
2. Perform XOR operation on each corresponding bit
3. Return the result as a string

XOR logic:
- 0 XOR 0 = 0
- 0 XOR 1 = 1
- 1 XOR 0 = 1
- 1 XOR 1 = 0

```python
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Input are two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    Perform binary XOR on these inputs and return result also as a string.
    >>> string_xor('010', '110')
    '100'
    """
    result = ""
    for i in range(len(a)):
        # XOR the bits at position i
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            result += '0'
        else:
            result += '1'
    return result
```

This implementation:
- Iterates through each position in the strings
- Compares the bits at each position
- If they're the same, XOR result is '0'
- If they're different, XOR result is '1'
- Builds and returns the result string

The function works correctly for the given example:
- '010' XOR '110' = '100' (0⊕1=1, 1⊕1=0, 0⊕0=0)
