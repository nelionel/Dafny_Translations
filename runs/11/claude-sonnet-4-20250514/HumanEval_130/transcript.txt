def tri(n):

    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the

======THINKING======


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to implement the Tribonacci sequence with the given recurrence relations:

- tri(1) = 3
- tri(n) = 1 + n/2, if n is even
- tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1), if n is odd

The tricky part is that for odd n, we need tri(n+1) which hasn't been calculated yet. I'll need to use an iterative approach and handle the dependencies carefully.

```python
def tri(n):
    """Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
    the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Examples:
    tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]
    """
    if n == 0:
        return [1]
    
    # Initialize the result list
    result = [0] * (n + 1)
    result[0] = 1  # tri(0) = 1 (based on the example)
    
    if n >= 1:
        result[1] = 3  # tri(1) = 3
    
    # Calculate even numbers first (they don't depend on future values)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:  # even
            result[i] = 1 + i // 2
    
    # Calculate odd numbers (they depend on previous and next values)
    for i in range(3, n + 1, 2):  # odd numbers starting from 3
        result[i] = result[i - 1] + result[i - 2] + result[i + 1]
    
    return result
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this. Looking at the example more carefully:
- tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]
- This suggests tri(0) = 1, tri(1) = 3, tri(2) = 2, tri(3) = 8

Let me trace through the logic:
- tri(0) appears to be 1 (from the example)
- tri(1) = 3 (given)
- tri(2) = 1 + 2/2 = 2 (even rule)
- tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4) (odd rule, needs tri(4))
- tri(4) = 1 + 4/2 = 3 (even rule)
- So tri(3) = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8
