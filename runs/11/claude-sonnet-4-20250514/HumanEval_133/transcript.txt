======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def sum_squares(lst):

    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,

    Examples:

    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84

======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Take each number in the list
2. Round it up to the nearest integer (ceiling)
3. Square that integer
4. Sum all the squared values

Let me trace through the examples to verify my understanding:
- `[1,2,3]`: ceil(1)²+ ceil(2)² + ceil(3)² = 1² + 2² + 3² = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14 ✓
- `[1,4,9]`: ceil(1)² + ceil(4)² + ceil(9)² = 1² + 4² + 9² = 1 + 16 + 81 = 98 ✓
- `[1,3,5,7]`: ceil(1)² + ceil(3)² + ceil(5)² + ceil(7)² = 1² + 3² + 5² + 7² = 1 + 9 + 25 + 49 = 84 ✓
- `[1.4,4.2,0]`: ceil(1.4)² + ceil(4.2)² + ceil(0)² = 2² + 5² + 0² = 4 + 25 + 0 = 29 ✓
- `[-2.4,1,1]`: ceil(-2.4)² + ceil(1)² + ceil(1)² = (-2)² + 1² + 1² = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 ✓

```python
import math

    """You are given a list of numbers.
