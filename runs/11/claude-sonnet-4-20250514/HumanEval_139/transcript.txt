======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to implement a function that calculates the "Brazilian factorial" which is the product of all factorials from 1! to n!.

Let me break down the pattern:
- For n=1: 1! = 1
- For n=2: 2! × 1! = 2 × 1 = 2
- For n=3: 3! × 2! × 1! = 6 × 2 × 1 = 12
- For n=4: 4! × 3! × 2! × 1! = 24 × 6 × 2 × 1 = 288

Here's my implementation:

```python
def special_factorial(n):
    """The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
    where n > 0

    For example:
    >>> special_factorial(4)
    288

    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
    factorial of this integer.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return 1
    
    def factorial(num):
        """Helper function to calculate factorial of a number"""
        if num <= 1:
            return 1
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, num + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
    
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= factorial(i)
    
    return result
```

The function works by:
1. First checking if n <= 0 and returning 1 in that case
2. Defining a helper function `factorial()` to calculate the factorial of individual numbers
3. Iterating from 1 to n, calculating the factorial of each number and multiplying them together
4. Returning the final result

For n=4: 1! × 2! × 3! × 4! = 1 × 2 × 6 × 24 = 288 ✓
