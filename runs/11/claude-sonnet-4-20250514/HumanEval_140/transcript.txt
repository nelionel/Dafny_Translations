======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def fix_spaces(text):
    """
    Given a string text, replace all spaces in it with underscores, 
    and if a string has more than 2 consecutive spaces, 
    then replace all consecutive spaces with - 
    
    fix_spaces("Example") == "Example"
    fix_spaces("Example 1") == "Example_1"

======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Replace single spaces and pairs of consecutive spaces with underscores
2. Replace 3 or more consecutive spaces with a single dash
3. Handle the cases systematically

Let me trace through the examples:
- "Example" → "Example" (no spaces)
- "Example 1" → "Example_1" (single space becomes underscore)
- " Example 2" → "_Example_2" (single spaces become underscores)
- " Example   3" → "_Example-3" (single space becomes underscore, 3+ spaces become dash)

Here's my implementation:

```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    """
    Given a string text, replace all spaces in it with underscores, 
    and if a string has more than 2 consecutive spaces, 
    then replace all consecutive spaces with - 
    
    fix_spaces("Example") == "Example"
    fix_spaces("Example 1") == "Example_1"
    fix_spaces(" Example 2") == "_Example_2"
    fix_spaces(" Example   3") == "_Example-3"
    """
    result = ""
    i = 0
    
    while i < len(text):
        if text[i] == ' ':
            # Count consecutive spaces
            space_count = 0
            j = i
            while j < len(text) and text[j] == ' ':
                space_count += 1
                j += 1
            
            # Replace based on count
            if space_count > 2:
                result += '-'
            else:
                result += '_' * space_count
            
            i = j  # Skip all the spaces we just processed
        else:
            result += text[i]
            i += 1
    
    return result
```
