======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def sum_squares(lst):
    """"
    This function will take a list of integers. For all entries in the list, the function shall square the integer entry if its index is a 
    multiple of 3 and will cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will not 
    change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries. 
    
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 6
    For lst = []  the output should be 0
    For lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]  the output should be -126

======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. For each element in the list, check its index
2. If index is a multiple of 3: square the element
3. If index is a multiple of 4 but NOT a multiple of 3: cube the element
4. Otherwise: keep the element unchanged
5. Return the sum of all processed elements

Let me trace through the examples:
- `[1,2,3]`: index 0 (multiple of 3) → 1² = 1, index 1 → 2, index 2 → 3. Sum = 1+2+3 = 6
- `[]`: empty list → sum = 0
- `[-1,-5,2,-1,-5]`: 
  - index 0 (multiple of 3) → (-1)² = 1
  - index 1 → -5
  - index 2 → 2
  - index 3 (multiple of 3) → (-1)² = 1
  - index 4 (multiple of 4, not 3) → (-5)³ = -125
  - Sum = 1 + (-5) + 2 + 1 + (-125) = -126
