You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def compare(game,guess):
    """I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
    event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
    definitely worth noting down and comparing.
    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.
    
    
    example:

    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]
    """


======THINKING======


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Compare two arrays of equal length (game scores and guesses)
2. For each index, calculate the absolute difference between the actual score and the guess
3. Return an array with these differences (0 if correct, absolute difference if wrong)

Let me trace through the examples:
- `compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2])` → `[0,0,0,0,3,3]`
  - Index 0: |1-1| = 0
  - Index 1: |2-2| = 0  
  - Index 2: |3-3| = 0
  - Index 3: |4-4| = 0
  - Index 4: |5-2| = 3
  - Index 5: |1-(-2)| = 3

- `compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2])` → `[4,4,1,0,0,6]`
  - Index 0: |0-4| = 4
  - Index 1: |5-1| = 4
  - Index 2: |0-1| = 1
  - Index 3: |0-0| = 0
  - Index 4: |0-0| = 0
  - Index 5: |4-(-2)| = 6

```python
def compare(game, guess):
    """
    Compares game scores with guesses and returns absolute differences.
    
    Args:
        game: List of actual game scores
        guess: List of guessed scores
    
    Returns:
        List of absolute differences between actual and guessed scores
    """
    result = []
    
    for i in range(len(game)):
        difference = abs(game[i] - guess[i])
        result.append(difference)
    
    return result
```
