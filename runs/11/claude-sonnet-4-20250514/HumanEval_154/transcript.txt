======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Check if the second word `b` or any of its rotations is a substring of the first word `a`
2. A rotation means moving characters from the beginning to the end (or vice versa)
3. For a word of length n, there are n possible rotations

Let me trace through the examples:
- `cycpattern_check("abcd","abd")` => False: "abd", "bda", "dab" - none are substrings of "abcd"
- `cycpattern_check("hello","ell")` => True: "ell" is directly a substring of "hello"
- `cycpattern_check("abab","baa")` => True: rotations of "baa" are "baa", "aab", "aba" - "aba" is a substring of "abab"

```python
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    """You are given 2 words. You need to return True if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word
    cycpattern_check("abcd","abd") => False
    cycpattern_check("hello","ell") => True
    cycpattern_check("whassup","psus") => False
    cycpattern_check("abab","baa") => True
    cycpattern_check("efef","eeff") => False
    cycpattern_check("himenss","simen") => True
    """
    if not b:  # Empty string case
        return True
    
    # Generate all rotations of word b
    for i in range(len(b)):
        # Create rotation by moving first i characters to the end
        rotation = b[i:] + b[:i]
        # Check if this rotation is a substring of a
        if rotation in a:
            return True
    
    return False
```

The algorithm works by:
1. Iterating through all possible rotation positions (0 to len(b)-1)
2. For each position i, creating a rotation by taking characters from position i to the end, plus characters from the beginning to position i
3. Checking if this rotation exists as a substring in word a
4. Returning True as soon as we find a match, or False if no rotation matches

Time complexity: O(n * m) where n is the length of word b and m is the length of word a.
Space complexity: O(n) for storing the rotations.
