def even_odd_count(num):
    """Given an integer. return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.

     Example:
        even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)

======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Handle negative numbers by taking the absolute value
2. Count even digits (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) and odd digits (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
3. Return a tuple with (even_count, odd_count)

```python
def even_odd_count(num):
    """Given an integer. return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.

     Example:
        even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)
        even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)
    """
    # Convert to absolute value to handle negative numbers
    num = abs(num)
    
    # Convert to string to iterate through digits
    num_str = str(num)
    
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Count even and odd digits
    for digit_char in num_str:
        digit = int(digit_char)
        if digit % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
    
    return (even_count, odd_count)
```

The function works by:
1. Taking the absolute value of the input number to ignore the sign
2. Converting the number to a string to easily iterate through each digit
3. For each digit character, converting it back to an integer and checking if it's even (divisible by 2) or odd
4. Counting the even and odd digits separately
5. Returning a tuple with the counts in the format (even_count, odd_count)
