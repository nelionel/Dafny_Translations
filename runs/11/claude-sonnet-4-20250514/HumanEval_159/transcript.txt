    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,
    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,
                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]
    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
    
    Example:
    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
    * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]

        the number of carrots that you have eaten.
    @need : integer
        the number of carrots that you need to eat.
    @remaining : integer
        the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock
    
    Constrain:

======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Calculate how many carrots the rabbit can actually eat (limited by need and remaining)
2. Return the total carrots eaten and the remaining carrots after eating

Let me trace through the examples:
- `eat(5, 6, 10)`: Already ate 5, needs 6 more, has 10 available → can eat all 6 needed → total = 5+6=11, remaining = 10-6=4
- `eat(4, 8, 9)`: Already ate 4, needs 8 more, has 9 available → can eat all 8 needed → total = 4+8=12, remaining = 9-8=1
- `eat(1, 10, 10)`: Already ate 1, needs 10 more, has 10 available → can eat all 10 needed → total = 1+10=11, remaining = 10-10=0
- `eat(2, 11, 5)`: Already ate 2, needs 11 more, has 5 available → can only eat 5 (limited by stock) → total = 2+5=7, remaining = 5-5=0

```python
