======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this function, I need to implement a linear transformation that maps the minimum value to 0 and the maximum value to 1.

The mathematical formula for this transformation is:
- For each number `x` in the list: `(x - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)`

This works because:
- When `x = min_value`: `(min_value - min_value) / (max_value - min_value) = 0`
- When `x = max_value`: `(max_value - min_value) / (max_value - min_value) = 1`

```python
from typing import List


def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
    [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
    """
    min_val = min(numbers)
    max_val = max(numbers)
    
    # Handle edge case where all numbers are the same
    if min_val == max_val:
        return [0.0] * len(numbers)
    
    range_val = max_val - min_val
    
    return [(x - min_val) / range_val for x in numbers]
```
