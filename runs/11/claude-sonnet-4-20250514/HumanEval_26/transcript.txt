======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Remove elements that occur more than once in the list
2. Keep the order of remaining elements the same as in the input
3. Only keep elements that appear exactly once

Let me trace through the example:
- `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4]`
- 1 appears once → keep it
- 2 appears twice → remove all occurrences
- 3 appears once → keep it
- 4 appears once → keep it
- Result: `[1, 3, 4]`

Here's my implementation:

```python
from typing import List


def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """
    # Count occurrences of each number
    count = {}
    for num in numbers:
        count[num] = count.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Keep only numbers that appear exactly once, maintaining order
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if count[num] == 1:
            result.append(num)
    
    return result
```

The algorithm works by:
1. First pass: Count how many times each number appears in the list
2. Second pass: Go through the original list in order and only include numbers that appeared exactly once

This maintains the original order while removing all instances of numbers that appear more than once.
