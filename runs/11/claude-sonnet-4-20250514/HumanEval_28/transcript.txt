======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

from typing import List


def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    """


======THINKING======


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Here's the implementation of the `concatenate` function:

```python
from typing import List


def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```

The function uses Python's built-in `join()` method to concatenate all strings in the list. The `join()` method is called on an empty string `''` as the separator, which means the strings will be joined together without any separator between them. This approach is efficient and handles both empty lists (returning an empty string) and lists with multiple strings.
