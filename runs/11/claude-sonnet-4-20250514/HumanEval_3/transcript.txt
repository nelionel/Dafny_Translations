======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Start with a balance of 0
2. Process each operation (deposit/withdrawal) in sequence
3. Check if the balance ever goes below zero
4. Return True if it does, False otherwise

Let me trace through the examples:
- `[1, 2, 3]`: 0→1→3→6 (never below zero, return False)
- `[1, 2, -4, 5]`: 0→1→3→-1→4 (goes below zero at -1, return True)

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fallls below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
    False
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
    True
    """
    balance = 0
    
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    
    return False
```

The solution:
1. Initialize `balance` to 0 (starting balance)
2. Iterate through each operation in the list
3. Add the operation to the current balance (positive for deposits, negative for withdrawals)
4. Check if balance is below zero after each operation
5. Return True immediately if balance goes below zero
6. Return False if we complete all operations without going below zero
