======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

======THINKING======


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Extract elements at indices divisible by 3 (0, 3, 6, 9, ...)
2. Sort those elements
3. Create a new list where:
   - Elements at indices NOT divisible by 3 remain unchanged
   - Elements at indices divisible by 3 are replaced with the sorted values

Let me trace through the examples:
- `[1, 2, 3]`: indices 0 has value 1, so sorted values are [1]. Result: [1, 2, 3]
- `[5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]`: indices 0, 3, 6 have values [5, 4, 2], sorted: [2, 4, 5]. Result: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """
    if not l:
        return []
    
    # Extract elements at indices divisible by 3
    third_elements = [l[i] for i in range(0, len(l), 3)]
    
    # Sort these elements
    third_elements.sort()
    
    # Create result list
    result = l.copy()
    
    # Replace elements at indices divisible by 3 with sorted values
    third_index = 0
    for i in range(0, len(l), 3):
        result[i] = third_elements[third_index]
        third_index += 1
    
    return result
