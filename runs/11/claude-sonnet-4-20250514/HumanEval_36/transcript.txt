======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
    >>> fizz_buzz(50)

    >>> fizz_buzz(78)

    >>> fizz_buzz(79)
    3
    """


======THINKING======


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Find all integers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13
2. Count how many times the digit 7 appears in those numbers
3. Return the total count

Let me trace through the examples:
- `fizz_buzz(50)`: Numbers divisible by 11 or 13 less than 50 are [11, 13, 22, 26, 33, 39, 44]. None contain digit 7, so return 0.
- `fizz_buzz(78)`: Numbers include [..., 77] where 77 is divisible by 11 and contains two 7s, so return 2.
- `fizz_buzz(79)`: Same as above plus 78 (divisible by 13) which contains one 7, so return 3.

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
    >>> fizz_buzz(50)
    0
    >>> fizz_buzz(78)
    2
    >>> fizz_buzz(79)
    3
    """
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            # Count occurrences of digit 7 in this number
            count += str(i).count('7')
    
    return count
```
