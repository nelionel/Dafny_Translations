======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal
    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
    [3, 6, 5, 4]
    """


======THINKING======


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this function, I need to:

1. Extract values at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.)
2. Sort those values
3. Create a new list where odd indices remain the same, but even indices get the sorted values

Let me trace through the examples:
- `[1, 2, 3]`: Even indices are 0,2 with values [1,3]. Sorted: [1,3]. Result: [1,2,3]
- `[5, 6, 3, 4]`: Even indices are 0,2 with values [5,3]. Sorted: [3,5]. Result: [3,6,5,4]

```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal
    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
    [3, 6, 5, 4]
    """
    if not l:
        return []
    
    # Extract values at even indices and sort them
    even_values = [l[i] for i in range(0, len(l), 2)]
    even_values.sort()
    
    # Create result list
    result = l.copy()
    
    # Replace even indices with sorted values
    even_idx = 0
    for i in range(0, len(l), 2):
        result[i] = even_values[even_idx]
        even_idx += 1
    
    return result
```
