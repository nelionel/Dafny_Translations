def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation

    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0

======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to implement the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) formula:
1. Calculate the mean of the dataset
2. Find the absolute difference between each element and the mean
3. Calculate the average of these absolute differences

Here's the implementation:

```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """
    # Calculate the mean of the dataset
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the absolute deviations from the mean
    absolute_deviations = [abs(x - mean) for x in numbers]
    
    # Return the average of the absolute deviations
    return sum(absolute_deviations) / len(absolute_deviations)
```

The implementation works as follows:
1. First, I calculate the mean by summing all numbers and dividing by the count
2. Then I create a list of absolute deviations by taking the absolute value of each number minus the mean
3. Finally, I return the average of these absolute deviations

For the example `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]`:
- Mean = (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5
- Absolute deviations: |1-2.5|=1.5, |2-2.5|=0.5, |3-2.5|=0.5, |4-2.5|=1.5
- MAD = (1.5+0.5+0.5+1.5)/4 = 1.0
