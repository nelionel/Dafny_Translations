def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.

======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to think about what happens when two sets of cars moving in opposite directions pass through each other.

Let me analyze the situation:
- n cars moving left to right
- n cars moving right to left
- All cars move at the same speed
- Cars are "infinitely sturdy" so they pass through each other when they collide
- I need to count the total number of collisions

Since all cars move at the same speed and the cars are infinitely sturdy (meaning they don't stop or change direction after collision), each car moving left to right will eventually encounter and collide with each car moving right to left.

Therefore, each of the n left-to-right cars will collide with each of the n right-to-left cars, giving us n × n = n² total collisions.

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.
    """
    return n * n
```

The key insight is that since the cars are infinitely sturdy and continue moving in their original directions after collision, every car from the left-to-right group will eventually collide with every car from the right-to-left group. This gives us n² total collisions.
