def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """


======THINKING======


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this function, I need to implement the formula for the area of a triangle given a base and height.

The area of a triangle is calculated as: **Area = (1/2) × base × height**

Here's the implementation:

```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """
    return (a * h) / 2
```

This implementation:
- Takes two parameters: `a` (the length of the base side) and `h` (the height)
- Returns the area using the standard triangle area formula: (base × height) ÷ 2
- For the example given: `triangle_area(5, 3)` returns `(5 × 3) ÷ 2 = 7.5`
