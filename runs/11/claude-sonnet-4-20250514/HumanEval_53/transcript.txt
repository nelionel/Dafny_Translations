======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

======USER PROMPT======


def add(x: int, y: int):
    """Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """


======THINKING======


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Here's the Python script with the full implementation of the `add` function:

```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y

# Test the function with doctests
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

The implementation is straightforward - it takes two integer parameters `x` and `y` and returns their sum. I've also added the return type annotation `-> int` to make the function signature complete, and included a test block that will run the doctests when the script is executed directly.
