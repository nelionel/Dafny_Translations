======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this function, I need to implement a function that sums all integers from 1 to n (inclusive).

There are multiple ways to implement this:
1. Using a loop
2. Using the mathematical formula: n * (n + 1) / 2
3. Using Python's built-in sum() function

I'll use the mathematical formula as it's the most efficient approach:

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int):
    """sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
    >>> sum_to_n(30)
    465
    >>> sum_to_n(100)
    5050
    >>> sum_to_n(5)
    15
    >>> sum_to_n(10)
    55
    >>> sum_to_n(1)
    1
    """
    return n * (n + 1) // 2
```

This implementation uses the mathematical formula for the sum of the first n positive integers: n ร (n + 1) รท 2. I use integer division (`//`) to ensure we get an integer result, which is appropriate since we're summing integers.
