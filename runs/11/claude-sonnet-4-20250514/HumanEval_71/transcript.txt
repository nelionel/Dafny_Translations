def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise return -1
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.
    Example:
    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00
    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1
    '''

======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Check if the three sides form a valid triangle using the triangle inequality theorem
2. If valid, calculate the area using Heron's formula
3. Round to 2 decimal places
4. Return -1 if invalid

Here's the implementation:

```python
def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise return -1
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.
    Example:
    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00
    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1
    '''
    # Check if the three sides form a valid triangle
    # Triangle inequality: sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side
    if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:
        # Calculate area using Heron's formula
        # s = semi-perimeter
        s = (a + b + c) / 2
        
        # Area = sqrt(s * (s-a) * (s-b) * (s-c))
        area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5
        
        # Round to 2 decimal places
        return round(area, 2)
    else:
        return -1
```

The solution works as follows:

1. **Triangle Validity Check**: I verify that the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. All three conditions must be true: `a + b > c`, `a + c > b`, and `b + c > a`.

2. **Heron's Formula**: If the triangle is valid, I use Heron's formula to calculate the area:
   - First, calculate the semi-perimeter: `s = (a + b + c) / 2`
   - Then, the area is: `√(s × (s-a) × (s-b) × (s-c))`

3. **Rounding**: The result is rounded to 2 decimal places using `round(area, 2)`.

4. **Invalid Triangle**: If the triangle inequality is not satisfied, the function returns -1.

The examples work correctly:
- `triangle_area(3, 4, 5)` returns `6.00` (a valid right triangle)
- `triangle_area(1, 2, 10)` returns `-1` (invalid since 1 + 2 = 3 is not greater than 10)
