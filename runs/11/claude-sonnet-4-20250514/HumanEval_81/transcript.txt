======THINKING======


======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to create a function that converts numerical GPAs to letter grades based on the given grading scale.

Let me analyze the grading table:
- 4.0 exactly gets A+
- Greater than 3.7 gets A
- Greater than 3.3 gets A-
- And so on...
- 0.0 exactly gets E

I'll implement this using a series of if-elif statements to check each condition in order:

```python
def numerical_letter_grade(grades):
    """It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades
    to students. The teacher has been making her own algorithm for grading.
    The only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.
    She has given you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write 
    a function that can output a list of letter grades using the following table:
             GPA       |    Letter grade
              4.0                A+
            > 3.7                A 
            > 3.3                A- 
            > 3.0                B+
            > 2.7                B 
            > 2.3                B-
            > 2.0                C+
            > 1.7                C
            > 1.3                C-
            > 1.0                D+ 
            > 0.7                D 
            > 0.0                D-
              0.0                E
    

    Example:
    grade_equation([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) ==> ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']
    """
    letter_grades = []
    
    for gpa in grades:
        if gpa == 4.0:
            letter_grades.append('A+')
        elif gpa > 3.7:
            letter_grades.append('A')
        elif gpa > 3.3:
            letter_grades.append('A-')
        elif gpa > 3.0:
            letter_grades.append('B+')
        elif gpa > 2.7:
            letter_grades.append('B')
        elif gpa > 2.3:
            letter_grades.append('B-')
        elif gpa > 2.0:
            letter_grades.append('C+')
        elif gpa > 1.7:
            letter_grades.append('C')
        elif gpa > 1.3:
            letter_grades.append('C-')
        elif gpa > 1.0:
            letter_grades.append('D+')
        elif gpa > 0.7:
            letter_grades.append('D')
        elif gpa > 0.0:
            letter_grades.append('D-')
        else:  # gpa == 0.0
            letter_grades.append('E')
    
    return letter_grades
```

The function works by:
1. Creating an empty list to store the letter grades
2. Iterating through each GPA in the input list
3. Using if-elif statements to check each condition in descending order
4. Appending the appropriate letter grade to the result list
5. Returning the complete list of letter grades

This implementation correctly handles the example: `[4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]` would return `['A+', 'B+', 'C', 'C+', 'A-']`.
