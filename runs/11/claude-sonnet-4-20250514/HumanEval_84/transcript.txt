======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def solve(N):
    """Given a positive integer N, return the total sum of its digits in binary.
    
    Example
        For N = 1000, the sum of digits will be 1 the output should be "1".
        For N = 150, the sum of digits will be 6 the output should be "110".
        For N = 147, the sum of digits will be 12 the output should be "1100".
    
    Variables:
        @N integer
             Constraints: 0 ≤ N ≤ 10000.
    Output:
         a string of binary number

======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Calculate the sum of all digits in the given integer N
2. Convert that sum to binary representation
3. Return the binary as a string

Let me trace through the examples:
- N = 1000: digits are 1, 0, 0, 0 → sum = 1 → binary of 1 is "1"
- N = 150: digits are 1, 5, 0 → sum = 6 → binary of 6 is "110"
- N = 147: digits are 1, 4, 7 → sum = 12 → binary of 12 is "1100"

```python
def solve(N):
    """Given a positive integer N, return the total sum of its digits in binary.
    
    Example
        For N = 1000, the sum of digits will be 1 the output should be "1".
        For N = 150, the sum of digits will be 6 the output should be "110".
        For N = 147, the sum of digits will be 12 the output should be "1100".
    
    Variables:
        @N integer
             Constraints: 0 ≤ N ≤ 10000.
    Output:
         a string of binary number
    """
    # Calculate sum of digits
    digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(N))
    
    # Convert sum to binary and remove '0b' prefix
    binary_result = bin(digit_sum)[2:]
    
    return binary_result
```
