======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def add(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..


    Examples:
        add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2 
    """

======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Find elements that are at odd indices (positions 1, 3, 5, etc.)
2. Among those elements, only consider the even ones
3. Sum up those even elements that are at odd indices

Let me trace through the example:
- `[4, 2, 6, 7]`
- Index 0: 4 (even index, skip)
- Index 1: 2 (odd index, even number, include)
- Index 2: 6 (even index, skip)
- Index 3: 7 (odd index, odd number, skip)
- Result: 2

```python
def add(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..


    Examples:
        add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2 
    """
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        # Check if index is odd and element is even
        if i % 2 == 1 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            total += lst[i]
    return total
```
