def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'

======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Split the string into words (separated by spaces)
2. For each word, sort its characters in ascending order based on ASCII values
3. Keep the original order of words and preserve spaces between them

Let me trace through the examples:
- `'Hi'` → `'Hi'` (characters 'H' and 'i' are already in ASCII order since 'H'=72, 'i'=105)
- `'hello'` → `'ehllo'` (sorting 'h','e','l','l','o' gives 'e','h','l','l','o')
- `'Hello World!!!'` → `'Hello !!!Wdlor'` (sorting each word separately)

```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
    """
    # Split the string by spaces to get individual words
    words = s.split(' ')
    
    # Process each word by sorting its characters
    result_words = []
    for word in words:
        # Sort the characters in the word based on ASCII values
        sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))
        result_words.append(sorted_word)
    
    # Join the words back with spaces
    return ' '.join(result_words)
```

The solution works by:
1. Using `split(' ')` to separate words while preserving the exact spacing structure
2. For each word, using `sorted()` to sort characters by ASCII value, then `''.join()` to reconstruct the word
3. Using `' '.join()` to reconstruct the string with the original spacing between words

This preserves the original word order and spacing while sorting the characters within each word.
