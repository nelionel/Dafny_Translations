======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1
    """

======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Split the string into sentences using '.', '?', or '!' as delimiters
2. For each sentence, check if it starts with the word "I"
3. Count how many sentences start with "I"

Let me trace through the examples:
- "Hello world" - no sentence delimiters, doesn't start with "I" → 0
- "The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather" - three sentences: "The sky is blue", "The sun is shining", "I love this weather". Only the last one starts with "I" → 1

```python
def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1
    """
    import re
    
    # Split the string by sentence delimiters
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]', S)
    
    boredom_count = 0
    
    for sentence in sentences:
        # Strip whitespace and check if sentence starts with "I"
        sentence = sentence.strip()
        if sentence:  # Make sure sentence is not empty
            words = sentence.split()
            if words and words[0] == "I":
                boredom_count += 1
    
    return boredom_count
```
