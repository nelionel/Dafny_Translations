======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Find all prime numbers in the given list
2. Identify the largest prime number
3. Calculate the sum of digits of that largest prime number

Let me break this down:

```python
def skjkasdkd(lst):
    """You are given a list of integers.
    You need to find the largest prime value and return the sum of its digits.

    Examples:
    For lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] the output should be 10
    For lst = [1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1] the output should be 25
    For lst = [1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3] the output should be 13
    For lst = [0,724,32,71,99,32,6,0,5,91,83,0,5,6] the output should be 11
    For lst = [0,81,12,3,1,21] the output should be 3
    For lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] the output should be 7

    def is_prime(n):
        """Check if a number is prime"""
        if n < 2:
            return False
        if n == 2:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
        # Check odd divisors up to sqrt(n)
        i = 3
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
            i += 2
        return True
    
    def sum_of_digits(n):
        """Calculate the sum of digits of a number"""
        return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    
    # Find all prime numbers in the list
    primes = [num for num in lst if is_prime(num)]
    
    # If no primes found, return 0 (though this case isn't specified in examples)
    if not primes:
        return 0
    
    # Find the largest prime
    largest_prime = max(primes)
    
    # Return the sum of its digits
    return sum_of_digits(largest_prime)
```

Let me verify with the examples:

1. `[0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3]` - primes are 2,3,5,7,181. Largest is 181. Sum of digits: 1+8+1=10 ✓

2. `[1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1]` - primes are 2,3,5,4597. Largest is 4597. Sum of digits: 4+5+9+7=25 ✓

3. `[1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3]` - primes include 3,5107,109,163,23,2323. Largest is 5107. Sum of digits: 5+1+0+7=13 ✓

4. `[0,724,32,71,99,32,6,0,5,91,83,0,5,6]` - primes are 71,5,83. Largest is 83. Sum of digits: 8+3=11 ✓

5. `[0,81,12,3,1,21]` - prime is 3. Sum of digits: 3 ✓

6. `[0,8,1,2,1,7]` - primes are 2,7. Largest is 7. Sum of digits: 7 ✓

The solution looks correct!
