======SYSTEM PROMPT======
You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script with the full implementation of the function described in the user prompt. The implementation should be inside a markdown code block.

def count_upper(s):

    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    
    For example:
    count_upper('aBCdEf') returns 1
    count_upper('abcdefg') returns 0
    count_upper('dBBE') returns 0

======MODEL OUTPUT======
Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Check characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...)
2. Count how many of those characters are uppercase vowels (A, E, I, O, U)

Let me trace through the examples:
- `count_upper('aBCdEf')`: indices 0,2,4 have 'a','C','E' → only 'E' is uppercase vowel → returns 1
- `count_upper('abcdefg')`: indices 0,2,4,6 have 'a','c','e','g' → none are uppercase vowels → returns 0  
- `count_upper('dBBE')`: indices 0,2 have 'd','B' → none are uppercase vowels → returns 0

```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    
    For example:
    count_upper('aBCdEf') returns 1
    count_upper('abcdefg') returns 0
    count_upper('dBBE') returns 0
    """
    uppercase_vowels = 'AEIOU'
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):  # iterate through even indices
        if s[i] in uppercase_vowels:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```
